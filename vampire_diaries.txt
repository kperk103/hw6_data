Woods

Stefan:  For over a century, I have lived in secret; hiding in the shadows, alone in the world. Until now. I am a vampire. And this is my story.


Darren: An hour's drive to hear that crap. You know, it wasn't even a band. A guy with a guitar. An hour each way.
Brooke: He wasn't that bad.
Darren: He sounded like James Blunt.
Brooke: What's wrong with that?
Darren: We already have a James Blunt. One's all we need.
Brooke: So why did you come?
Darren: Because I love you.
Brooke: Nicely done. What's with all the fog?
Darren: It'll clear in a second.
Brooke: Watch out!


Darren: Are you okay?
Brooke: We just hit someone! Oh my god!
Darren: Call for help.
Brooke: Come on, come on!
Darren: Please be alive! Oh, my god.


Brooke: There's no signal! Darren! Darren?




Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: I shouldn't have come home. I know the risk. But I had no choice. I have to know her.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Dear diary, today will be different. It has to be. I will smile, and it will be believable. My smile will say I'm fine, thank you. Yes, I feel much better. I will no longer be the sad little girl who lost her parents. I will start fresh, be someone new. It's the only way I'll make it through.


Jenna: Toast. I can make toast.
Elena: It's all about the coffee, Aunt Jenna.
Jeremy: Is there coffee?
Jenna: Your first day of school and I'm totally unprepared. Lunch money?
Elena: I'm good.
Jenna: Anything else? A number two pencil? What am I missing?
Elena: Don't you have a big presentation today?
Jenna: I'm meeting with my thesis advisor at...now. Crap!
Elena: Then go. We'll be fine. You okay?
Jeremy: Don't start.


Bonnie's Car


Bonnie: So Grams is telling me I'm psychic. Our ancestors were from Salem, witches and all that, I know, crazy, but she's going on and on about it, and I'm like, put this woman in a home already! But then I started thinking, I predicted Obama and I predicted Heath Ledger, and I still think Florida will break off and turn into little resort islands...Elena! Back in the car.
Elena: I did it again, didn't I? I--I'm sorry, Bonnie. You were telling me that...
Bonnie: That I'm psychic now.
Elena: Right. Okay, then predict something. About me.
Bonnie: I see...


Bonnie: What was that?! Oh, my god! Elena, are you okay?
Elena: It's okay. I'm fine.
Bonnie: It was like a bird or something. It came out of nowhere.
Elena: Really, I can't be freaked out by cars for the rest of my life.
Bonnie: I predict this year is going to be kick ass. And I predict all the sad and dark times are over and you are going to be beyond happy.


Mystic Falls High School




Bonnie: Major lack of male real estate. Look at the shower curtain on Kelly Beech. She looks like a hot ,  can I still say  tranny mess?
Elena: No, that's over.
Bonnie: Ahh, find a man, coin a phrase. It's a busy year.


Elena: He hates me.
Bonnie: That's not hate. That's you dumped me, but I'm too cool to show it, but secretly I'm listening to Air Supply's greatest hits.


Caroline: Elena. Oh, my god.


Caroline: How are you? Oh, it's so good to see you. How is she? Is she good?
Elena: Caroline, I'm right here. And I'm fine. Thank you.
Caroline: Really?
Elena: Yes. Much better.
Caroline: Oh, you poor thing.


Elena: Okay, Caroline.
Caroline: Oh! Okay, see you guys later?
Bonnie: OK! Bye!
Elena: No comment.
Bonnie: I'm not going to say anything.


Jeremy: Don't take more than two in a six-hour window.


Tyler: Hey, Vicki. I knew I'd find you here with the crackheads.
Vicki: Hey.
Tyler: Hey, Pete Wentz called. He wants his nail polish back.
Jeremy: Pete Wentz, huh? How old school T.R.L. of you. Carson Daly fan?
Vicki: Oh, Ty, be nice. That's Elena's little brother.
Tyler: I know who he is. I'll still kick his ass.




Bonnie: Hold up. Who's this?
Elena: All I see is back.
Bonnie: It's a hot back.


Secretary: Your records are incomplete. You're missing immunization records, and we do insist on transcripts.
Stefan: Please look again. I'm sure everything you need is there.


Secretary: Well, you're right. So it is.


Bonnie: I'm sensing Seattle, and he plays the guitar.
Elena: You're really going to run this whole psychic thing into the ground, huh?
Bonnie: Pretty much.
Boy: Jeremy, good batch, man.
Elena: I'll be right back.
Bonnie: Please be hot.


Boy: Whoa! Pants down, chick!


Elena: Great. It's the first day of school and you're stoned.
Jeremy: No, I'm not.
Elena: Where is it? Is it on you?
Jeremy: Stop, all right?! You need to chill yourself, all right?
Elena: Chill myself? What is that, stoner talk? Dude, you are so cool.
Jeremy: Look, stop! I don't have anything on me. Are you crazy?
Elena: You haven't seen crazy, Jeremy! I gave you a summer pass, but I am done watching you destroy yourself. No, no, no, you know what? Go ahead. Keep it up. But just know that I am going to be there to ruin your buzz every time, you got it? Jeremy, I know who you are. And it's not this person. So don't be this person.
Jeremy: I don't need this.




Stefan: Thank you.
Secretary: You're welcome.


Stefan: Uh, pardon me. Um...is this the men's room?
Elena: Yes. Um, I was just, Um, I was just, It's a long story....


Elena: Thank you.


Tanner: Once our home state of Virginia joined confederacy in 1861, it created a tremendous amount of tension within the state. People in Virginia's northwest region had different ideals than those from the traditional deep south. Then Virginia divided in 1863 with the northwest region joining the union. 


Bonnie : HAWT-E. STARING at U.


Cemetery


Elena: Dear diary, I made it through the day. I must have said, I'm fine, thanks, at least thirty-seven times. And I didn't mean it once. But no one noticed. When someone asks, How are you? They really don't want an answer.


Elena: Okay. Hi, bird. That's not creepy or anything. Shoo!


Elena: That's what I thought.


Elena: Ahh!


Stefan: You okay?
Elena: Were you following me?
Stefan: No, I-a, uh, I-a just ,  I saw you fall.
Elena: Uh-huh, and you just happened to be hanging out in a cemetery.
Stefan: I'm visiting. I have family here.
Elena: Oh. Wow. Tactless. I'm sorry. It's the fog, It's making me foggy. And then back there, there was this - this bird, and it was all very Hitchcock for a second. That is the bird movie, right, the Hitchcock?...I'm Elena.
Stefan: I'm Stefan.
Elena: I know. We have History together.
Stefan: And English and French.
Elena: Right.


Elena: Thanks...Nice ring.
Stefan: Oh. Um, It's a family ring, yeah. I'm kinda stuck with it. It's weird, huh?
Elena: No, no. It's just, I mean, there are rings and then there's that.
Stefan: Did you hurt yourself?
Elena: Hmm?
Stefan: Did you hurt yourself?
Elena: Oh, uh, I don't know.


Elena: Oh! Would you look at that. That is not pretty.
.

Elena: Are you okay?


Stefan: You should go. Take care of that.
Elena: Really, it's nothing.


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: I lost control today. Everything I've kept buried inside came rushing to the surface. I'm simply not able to resist her.
Mystic Grill
Jeremy: Hey Vick.
Vicki: Working.


Matt: Thanks, Vick.
Vicki: Do you need another refill?
Tyler: I'd love one.


Matt: Please tell me you're not hooking up with my sister.
Tyler: I'm not hooking up with your sister.
Matt: You're such a dick.


Jeremy: Hey, what's your deal? I mean, summer you act one way and then school starts and you can't be bothered.
Vicki: Look, Jeremy, I really appreciate all the pharmaceuticals, but you can't keep following me around like a lost puppy.
Jeremy: When's the last time you had sex with a puppy?
Vicki: Hey, keep it down. I don't want to tell the whole world I deflowered Elena's kid brother.
Jeremy: Yeah, and deflowered and deflowered.
Vicki: We hooked up a few times in a drug haze. It's over. You gotta back off before you ruin things between me and Tyler.
Jeremy: Oh,come on, the guy's a total douche. He only wants you for your ass.
Vicki: Yeah? What do you want me for?


Caroline: His name is Stefan Salvatore. He lives with uncle up at the old Salvatore Boarding House. He hasn't lived here since he was a kid. Military family, so they moved around a lot. He's a Gemini, and his favorite color is blue.
Bonnie: You got all of that in one day?
Caroline: Oh, please, I got all that between third and fourth period. We're planning a June wedding.
Gilbert Residence
Elena: I'm meeting Bonnie at the grill.
Jenna: Okay, have fun. Wait, I got this. Don't stay out late, it's a school night.
Elena: Well done, Aunt Jenna.


Elena: Oh.
Stefan: Sorry, I was about to knock. I wanted to apologize for my disappearing act earlier. I know it was...strange.
Elena: No worries. I get it, blood makes you squeamish.
Stefan: Um, something like that. How's your leg?
Elena: Oh, it's fine. Just a scratch, barely. How did you know where I lived?
Stefan: It's a small town. I asked the first person I saw. Um, I thought you might want this back.


Elena: Oh, I must have dropped it. I--thank you.
Stefan: Don't worry, I didn't...read it.
Elena: No? Why not? Most people would have.
Stefan: Well, I wouldn't want anyone to read mine.
Elena: You keep a journal?
Stefan: Yeah, if I don't write it down, I forget it. Memories are too important.
Elena: Yeah. I'm just gonna...umm, you don't have to stay out there.


Stefan: I'm fine. Sorry, were you going somewhere?
Elena: Yeah, I'm meeting a friend. Do you want to come?
Mystic Grill
Matt: How's Elena doing?
Bonnie: Her mom and dad died. How do you think? She's putting on a good face, but it's only been four months.
Matt: Has she said anything about me?
Bonnie: Oh, no. So not getting in the middle. You pick up the phone and call her.
Matt: I feel weird calling her. She broke up with me.
Bonnie: Give it more time, Matt.


Matt: More time, huh?


Matt: Hey, I'm Matt, nice to meet you.
Stefan: Hi. Stefan.
Elena: Hey.
Matt: Hey.
Caroline: So, you were born in Mystic Falls?
Stefan: Mm-Hmm. And moved when I was still young.
Bonnie: Parents?
Stefan: My parents passed away.
Elena: I'm sorry. Any siblings?
Stefan: None that I talk to. I live with my uncle.
Caroline: So, Stefan, if you're new, then you don't know about the party tomorrow.
Bonnie: It's a back to school thing at the falls.
Stefan : Are you going?
Bonnie: Of course she is.
Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: You promised.


Stefan: This was an animal attack.
Zach: Don't give me that. I know the game. You tear them up enough, they always suspect an animal attack. You said you had it under control.
Stefan: And I do.
Zach: Please, Uncle Stefan. Mystic Falls is a different place now. It's been quiet for years, but there are people who still remember. And you being here, it's just going to stir things up.
Stefan: It's not my intention.
Zach: Then what is? Why did you come back? After all this time, why now?
Stefan: I don't have to explain myself.
Zach: I know that you can't change what you are. But you don't belong here anymore.
Stefan: Where do I belong?
Zach: I can't tell you what to do. But coming back here was a mistake.

Mystic Falls High School


Tanner: The Battle of Willow Creek took place right at the end of the war in our very own Mystic Falls. How many casualties resulted in this battle? Ms. Bennett?
Bonnie: Um...a lot? I'm not sure. Like a whole lot.
Tanner: Cute becomes dumb in an instant, Ms. Bennett. Mr. Donovan? Would you like to take this opportunity to overcome your embedded jock stereotype?
Matt: It's okay, Mr. Tanner, I'm cool with it.
Tanner: Hmm. Elena? Surely you can enlighten us about one of the town's most significantly historical events?
Elena: I'm sorry, I--I don't know.
Tanner: I was willing to be lenient last year for obvious reasons, Elena. But the personal excuses ended with summer break.
Stefan: There were 346 casualties. Unless you're counting local civilians.
Tanner: That's correct. Mister...?
Stefan: Salvatore.
Tanner: Salvatore. Any relation to the original settlers here at Mystic Falls?
Stefan: Distant.
Tanner: Well, very good. Except, of course, there were no civilian casualties in this battle.
Stefan: Actually, there were 27, sir. Confederate soldiers, they fired on the church, believing it to be housing weapons. They were wrong. It was a night of great loss. The founder's archives are, uh, stored in civil hall if you'd like to brush up on your facts, Mr. Tanner.
Tanner: Hmm.
Woods


Bonnie: Just admit it, Elena.
Elena: Oh, okay, so he's a little pretty.
Bonnie: He has that romance novel stare.


Caroline: Hey! You made it!
Stefan: I did.
Caroline: Well, let's get you a drink.
Stefan: Well, I'm--
Caroline: Oh, come on.


Bonnie: So where is he?
Elena: I don't know. You tell me, you're the psychic one.
Bonnie: Right, I forgot. Okay, so give me a sec. Grams says I have to concentrate.
Elena: Wait, you need a crystal ball.


Elena: What?
Bonnie: That was weird. When I touched you, I saw a crow.
Elena: What?
Bonnie: A crow. There was fog, a man. I'm drunk. It's the drinking. There's nothing psychic about it. Yeah? Ok, I'm gonna get a refill.


Elena: Okay? Bonnie!


Stefan: Hi.
Elena: Hi.
Stefan: I did it again, didn't it?
Elena: Yeah.
Stefan: I'm sorry. You're upset about something.
Elena: Oh, uh, no, it's- it's just Bonnie. She's...You know what? Never mind. You're...here.
Stefan: I'm here.


Elena: You know, you're kind of the talk of the town.
Stefan: Am I?
Elena: Mmm hmm. Mysterious new guy, oh, yeah.
Stefan: Well, you have the mysterious thing going, too. Twinged in sadness.
Elena: What makes you think that I'm sad?
Stefan: Well, we did meet in a graveyard.
Elena: Right. Well, no, technically we met in the men's room. You don't want to know, it's....it's not exactly party chit-chat.
Stefan: Well, I've never really been very good at, uh, chit-chat.
Elena: Last spring. . my parents' car drove off of a bridge into the lake. And I was in the backseat and I survived, but...they didn't. So that's my story.
Stefan: You won't be sad forever, Elena.


Vicki: No, Ty. I'm not having sex against a tree.
Tyler: Oh, come on, it would be hot.
Vicki: For who? No, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen, not here, not like this. No. I said no. I said no! Ow, that hurts!


Jeremy: Hey, leave her alone!
Tyler: You know, you're starting to get on my nerves, Gilbert.
Vicki: Just go, Tyler, get the hell away from me.
Tyler: Wow. Vicki Donovan says no. That's a first.


Vicki: I didn't need your help.
Jeremy: It seems like you did.
Vicki: He was just drunk.
Jeremy: I'm drunk. Am I throwing myself at you?
Vicki: No, you're worse. You want to talk to me, get to know me, see into my soul and screw and screw and screw until you're done with me.
Jeremy: Is that what you think?
Vicki: That's what I know.


Stefan: I like Bonnie, she seems like a good friend.
Elena: Best friend in the world.
Stefan: And Matt, he can't seem to, uh, take his eyes off of us.
Elena: Matt's that friend since childhood that you start dating because you owe it to yourselves to see if you can be more.
Stefan: And?
Elena: And then my parents died, and everything changes. Anyway, Matt and I, together we just, I don't know, it wasn't, um...it wasn't...
Stefan: Passionate?
Elena: No. No, it wasn't passionate...


Elena: Hey, um, are you okay? Um, Your eye, it just, it's--
Stefan: Oh, um...Yeah, no. It's, um, it's nothing. Um, are you thirsty? I'm gonna get us a drink.




Vicki: Jeremy? Is that you?...Jeremy?




Matt: Looking for someone?
Elena: Hey.
Matt: When you broke up with me, you said it was because you needed some time alone. You don't look so alone to me.
Elena: Matt, you don't understand. It's--
Matt: That's okay, Elena. You do what you have to do. I just want to let you know that...I still believe in us. And I'm not giving up on that.
Elena: Matt...
Caroline: Hey! There you are. Have you been down to the falls yet? Because they are really cool at night. And I can show you...if you want.
Stefan: I think you've had too much to drink.
Caroline: Well, of course I have. So, 
Stefan: Caroline. You and me, it's not gonna happen. Sorry.


Elena: I was wondering who abducted you, but now I know.
Stefan: Is she like that with, uh, all the guys?
Elena: No. You're fresh meat. She'll back off eventually. Hmm. God, you gotta be kidding me!
Stefan: What is it?
Elena: My brother.
Stefan: The drunk one?
Elena: That would be the one. Excuse me.
Stefan: Need some help?
Elena: Trust me, you're not going to want to witness this. Jeremy! Jeremy!


Elena: Jeremy, where the hell are you going?
Jeremy: I don't want to hear it!
Elena: Yeah, well, too bad!


Jeremy: Vicki? No! Oh, my god, it's Vicki!
Elena: Oh, my god!
Jeremy: No!


Elena: Somebody help!
Matt: Vicki? Vicki, what the hell?!
Tyler: What happened to her?
Matt: Somebody, call an ambulance!
Tyler: Everybody back up, give her some space!
Elena: It's her neck. Something bit her. She's losing a lot of blood.
Boy: Put this on her neck.
Matt: Vicki, Vicki, come on, open your eyes, look at me.
Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: What's going on?
Stefan: Someone else was attacked tonight, Zach, and it wasn't me.


Stefan: Damon.


Damon: Hello, brother.
Stefan: Crow's a bit much, don't you think?
Damon: Wait till you see what I can do with the fog.
Stefan: When'd you get here?
Damon: Well, I couldn't miss your first day at school. Your hair's different. I like it.
Stefan: It's been 15 years, Damon.
Damon: Thank God. I couldn't take another day of the nineties. That horrible grunge look? Did not suit you. Remember, Stefan, it's important to stay away from fads.
Stefan: Why are you here?
Damon: I miss my little brother.
Stefan: You hate small towns. It's boring. There's nothing for you to do.
Damon: I've managed to keep myself busy.
Stefan: You know, you left that girl alive tonight. That's very clumsy of you.
Damon: Ah. That can be a problem...for you.
Stefan: Why are you here now?
Damon: I could ask you the same question. However, I'm fairly certain your answer can be summed up all into one little word...Elena.
Woods


Bonnie: Hey. We're gonna go to Mainline Coffee, wait for news.
Elena: I gotta take Jeremy home.
Bonnie: Elena, there's no way I'm psychic. I know that. But whatever I saw, or I think I saw, I have this feeling...
Elena: Bonnie, what?
Bonnie: That it's just the beginning.
Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: She took my breath away. Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine. Is it working, Stefan? Being around her, being in her world? Does it make you feel alive?
Stefan: She's not Katherine.
Damon: Well, let's hope not. We both know how that ended. Tell me something, when's the last time you had something stronger than a squirrel?
Stefan: I know what you're doing, Damon. It's not gonna work.
Damon: Yeah? Come on. Don't you crave a little?


Stefan: Stop it.
Damon: Let's do it. Together. I saw a couple girls out there. Or just, let's just cut to the chase, let's just go straight for Elena.
Stefan: Stop it!
Damon: Imagine what her blood tastes like!


Damon: I can.
Stefan: I said stop!


Damon: I was impressed. I give it a six. Missing style, but I was pleasantly surprised. Very good with the whole face...thing. It was good.
Stefan: You know, it's all fun and games, Damon, huh? But wherever you go, people die.
Damon: That's a given.
Stefan: Not here. I won't allow it.
Damon: I take that as an invitation.
Stefan: Damon, please. After all these years, can't we just give it a rest?
Damon: I promised you an eternity of misery, so I'm just keeping my word.
Stefan: Just stay away from Elena.
Damon: Where's your ring? Oh, yeah, sun's coming up in a couple of hours, and, poof, ashes to ashes. Relax. It's right here.


Damon: You should know better than to think you're stronger than me. You lost that fight when you stopped feeding on people. I wouldn't try it again. I think we woke Zach up. Sorry, Zach.
Woods


Elena: You okay? I called Jenna, she's on her way. Those people in uniforms, last time I checked, they're the police. People are going to stop giving you breaks, Jer. They just don't care anymore. They don't remember that our parents are dead, because they've got their own lives to deal with. The rest of the world has moved on. You should try, too.
Jeremy: I've seen you in the cemetery writing in your diary. Is that--is that supposed to be you moving on?
Elena: Mom and Dad wouldn't have wanted this.
Mystic Grill
Bonnie: Are you sober yet?
Caroline: No.
Bonnie: Keep drinking. I gotta get you home. I gotta get me home.
Caroline: Why didn't he go for me? You know, how come the guys that I want never want me?
Bonnie: I'm not touching that.
Caroline: I'm inappropriate. I always say the wrong thing. And...Elena always says the right thing. She doesn't even try! And he just picks her. And she's always the one that everyone picks, for everything. And I try so hard, and...I'm never the one.
Bonnie: It's not a competition, Caroline.
Caroline: Yeah, it is.
Hospital


Matt: Vicki...Hey. Hey, it's okay. You're gonna be okay.
Vicki: Matt--
Matt: Hey, don't try to talk, okay? You're fine.
Vicki: Vampire.

Gilbert Residence and Salvatore Boarding House
Elena: Dear diary, I couldn't have been more wrong. I thought that I could smile, nod my way through it; pretend like it would all be ok.
Stefan: I had a plan. I wanted to change who I was; create a life as someone new, someone without the past.
Elena: Without the pain.
Elena and Stefan: Someone alive.
Elena: But it's not that easy. The bad things stay with you.
Stefan: They follow you.
Mystic Grill


Stefan:  You can't escape them, as much as you want to.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: All you can do is be ready for the good. So when it comes, you invite it in, because you need it. I need it.


Stefan: I know it's late. But, uh...I needed to know that you were ok.
Elena: You know, for months, that's all anyone's wondered about me. If I'll be ok.
Stefan: What do you tell them?
Elena: That I'll be fine.
Stefan: Do you ever mean it?
Elena: Ask me tomorrow. It's warmer in the house. We can talk. Would you like to come in?
Stefan: Yes.


Woods


Woman: Hey. Did you hear that?
Man: Hear what?
Woman: I heard thunder.
Man: There's no thunder.
Woman: Are you sure? Because if it rains, then we won't be able to see the comet.
Man: It's not gonna rain. Listen, I...got you a little something. It's back in the car. Don't you move.
Woman: Stay dry.
Man: It's not gonna rain.


Woman: I knew it! I told you it was gonna rain!


Woman: Open! No! Please!




Gilbert Residence and Salvatore Boarding House
Elena: Dear diary, this morning is...different. There is change. I can sense it, feel it.
Stefan: I'm awake. For the first time in a long time, I feel completely and undeniably wide awake.
Elena: For once, I don't regret the day before it begins.
Stefan: I welcome the day...
Stefan and Elena: Because I know...
Stefan: I will see her again.
Elena: I will see him again. For the first time in a long time, I feel good.


Gilbert Residence
Jenna: Do I look adult? As in respectfully parental?
Elena: Depends on where you're going.
Jenna: Jeremy's parent-teacher conference. Hair up or down?


Elena: Sexy stewardess.


Elena: Boozy housewife.
Jenna: Up it is. You're feisty today.
Elena: I feel good, which is rare. So I've decided to go with it. Fly free, walk on the sunshine, and all that stuff. Where is Jeremy?
Jenna: He left early. Something about getting to wood shop early to finish a birdhouse.


Jenna: There is no wood shop, is there?
Elena: No.
Jenna: Yeah.
Hospital


Nurse: You can't be in here, hon. Visiting hours don't start till 9:00.
Jeremy: I just...how is she?
Nurse: She's lost a lot of blood.
Jeremy: Yeah, but she's gonna be OK, right?
Nurse: She needs her rest. So you come back later. Come on.
Mystic Falls High School


Tanner: Originally discovered nearly 5 centuries ago, it hasn't been over Mystic Falls in over 145 years. Now, the comet will be its brightest right after dusk during tomorrow's celebration. Are we bothering you, Mr. Salvatore? Ms. Gilbert?




Stefan: I brought it.  Told you.
Elena: Wuthering Heights by Ellis Bell. You know, I can't believe she didn't use her real name.
Stefan: All the Bronte sisters used pseudonyms. It was the time. Female writers weren't very accepted then.
Elena: Where did you get it?
Stefan: Uh, it was passed down. Through the family.
Elena: Ah.
Stefan: I have lots of books. Go ahead. Keep it.
Elena: Oh, no. I...but I would like to read it again. I promise I'll give it back.
Stefan: Ok.
Caroline: I'm confused. Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
Bonnie: Technically, Grams says I'm a witch. My ancestors were these really cool Salem witch chicks or something. Grams tried to explain it all, but she was looped on the liquor so I kinda tuned out. Crazy family, yes. Witches? I don't think so.
Caroline: Yeah, well, feel free to conjure up the name and number of that guy from last night.
Bonnie: I didn't see him, you did. Why didn't you just talk to him?
Caroline: I don't know. I was drunk.


Jeremy: Hey, Tyler. Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt. I was just wondering how Vicki's doing, since you guys are so close. Is she ok?
Tyler: She's fine. Now get out of here.
Jeremy: How bad is she? Do they know what attacked her? Is she going to make a full recovery? Was she happy to see you? What room number was she in?
Tyler: I'm gonna kick your ass.
Jeremy: Yeah, you keep saying that, but when are you actually going to do it? Huh? 'Cause I vote for right here and right now.


Tyler: Walk away, Gilbert. It's your final warning.
Jeremy: No, this is your final warning, dick. I'm sick of watching you play Vicki. If you hurt her one more time, I swear to God, I will kill you.


Tyler: Damn, that was like a death threat.  Did you hear that?


Matt: They're keeping her overnight to make sure there's no infection, but she should be able to come home tomorrow.
Elena: That's good news.
Matt: Yeah.
Elena: Did you get in touch with your mom?
Matt: Called and left a message. She's in Virginia Beach with her boyfriend, so...we'll see how long it takes her to come rushing home.
Elena: Vicki's lucky that she's ok.


Matt: I know, and now there's talk of some missing campers.
Elena: Did she say what kind of animal it was that attacked her?
Matt: She said it was a vampire.
Elena: What?
Matt: Yeah, she wakes up last night and mutters vampire and then passes out.
Elena: OK, that is weird.
Matt: I think she was drunk. So what's up with you and the new guy?
Elena: Matt, the last thing that I want to do is hurt you.
Matt: You know, I'm...I'm actually gonna go back to the hospital. I want to be there when Vicki wakes up, get the real story about last night.




Tanner: As Jeremy's teacher, I'm concerned. All right? It's the third day of school and he's skipped six of his classes.
Jenna: Mr. Tanner, are you aware that Jeremy and Elena's parents died?
Tanner: Four months ago, a great loss. Car accident. Wickery bridge, if I remember correctly. And you're related to the family how? The, uh, mother's kid sister?
Jenna: Younger sister.
Tanner: Right.
Jenna: Yes. Six classes? Are you sure? I mean, that's kind of hard to do.
Tanner: Not when you're on drugs. It's his attempt at coping, Ms. Sommers. And the signs are there. He's moody, withdrawn, argumentative, hungover. Are there any other relatives in the picture?
Jenna: I'm their sole guardian.
Tanner: Uh-huh. Could there be?
Jenna: What are you suggesting, exactly?
Tanner: It's an impossible job, isn't it, raising two teens?
Jenna: It's been tough, but, no, it's not.
Tanner: Wrong answer. It is an extremely impossible job, and anything less and you're not doing it properly.
Hospital


Matt: Whoa! Vick. Vicki, hey. Vick, it's Matt. Hey, what's wrong?
Vicki: No! No! Get off! No! No! No!
Matt: Nurse!


Stefan: It was an animal that attacked you. It came out of the night and jumped you. You blacked out. It's all you remember.
Vicki: It's all I remember.
Stefan: An animal attacked you. You blacked out. It's all you remember.
Vicki: It's all I remember.
Matt: Nurse! I need help! It's my sister.
Nurse: She seems fine.


Mystic Grill
Bonnie: Well, I was talking to Grams, and she said the comet is a sign of impending doom. The last time it passed over Mystic Falls, there was lots of death. So much blood and carnage, it created a bed of paranormal activity.
Caroline: Yeah, and then you poured Grams another shot and she told you about the aliens. So then what
Elena: So then nothing.
Caroline: You and Stefan talked all night? There was no sloppy first kiss or touchy feely of any kind?
Elena: Nope. We didn't go there.
Caroline: Not even a handshake? I mean, Elena, we are your friends. Ok? You are supposed to share the smut.
Elena: We just talked for hours.
Caroline: OK, what is with the blockage? Just jump his bones already! Ok, it's easy. Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, sex!
Elena: Profound.


Bonnie: Where are you going?
Elena: Caroline's right. It is easy. If I sit here long enough, I'll end up talking myself out of it instead of doing what I started the day saying what I was going to do.
Gilbert Residence
Jenna: I picked up dinner. Tacos. I had an urge for guacamole.
Jeremy: No, I'm good, thanks.
Jenna: Eat anyway. It's a ruse. I want to talk.


Jenna: Hey, you! Come. Sit.  Back in school, freshman year, I could eat my weight in nachos, with extra cheese. It was my munchie food whenever I got stoned.
Jeremy: You get high?
Jenna: Did. Past tense. But, yeah. Loved it. Anything to get a little distraction from life...reality. And it worked. For a while. Never lasts, though. Hey, I'm not saying I wouldn't love to rail back and kick it, but with a thesis looming and a waistline expanding...


Hospital


Matt: What the...
Vicki: Finally you're awake.
Matt: Hey. How are you feeling? You look better. I was worried before. You really had me freaked out with all that screaming.
Vicki: Wait, what are you talking about?
Matt: You don't remember?
Vicki: I feel fine.
Matt: Good, good. Doctor said you could come home tomorrow. Vick, what attacked you in the woods?


Vicki: An animal. What else could it have been?


Jeremy: Hey. How do you feel?
Vicki: I'm OK.
Matt: I...I'm gonna...I'm gonna go grab a coffee. Hey, Jer.
Vicki: Why are you here?
Jeremy: I just wanted to see how you were doing.
Vicki: Did you see that look on Matt's face? That was suspicion. I don't want people to find out about us, Jeremy.
Jeremy: Well, you gotta get over that.
Vicki: Tyler is finally showing some interest.
Jeremy: You have to get over that, too. Do you see Mr. Concerned? Tyler? Are you under there? No.
Vicki: It's not cool for people to know. Ok? I'm older than you, and Matt and Elena would freak.
Jeremy: No one's going to suspect anything. Why wouldn't I check on you? I mean, I'm the one who found you.
Vicki: You are?
Jeremy: Yeah, I carried you out of the woods.
Vicki: Thank you.
Jeremy: Yeah, you're welcome.
Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Stefan? Stefan?


Elena: I...I'm sorry for barging in. The door was...open.
Damon: You must be Elena. I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.
Elena: He didn't tell me he had a brother.
Damon: Well, Stefan's not one to brag. Please, come. I'm sure Stefan will be along any second.
Elena: Wow. This is your living room?
Damon: Living room, parlor, Sotheby's auction. It's a little kitschy for my taste. I see why my brother's so smitten. It's about time. For a while there, I never thought he'd get over the last one. Nearly destroyed him.
Elena: The last one?
Damon: Yeah. Katherine, his girlfriend? Oh, you two haven't had the awkward exes conversation yet.
Elena: Nope.
Damon: Oops. Well, I'm sure it'll come up now. Or maybe he didn't want to tell you because he didn't want you to think he was on the rebound. We all know how those relationships end.
Elena: You say it like every relationship is doomed to end.
Damon: I'm a fatalist. Hello, Stefan.
Stefan: Elena. I didn't know you were coming over.
Elena: I know. I should have called, I just...
Damon: Oh, don't be silly. You're welcome any time. Isn't she, Stefan? You know, I should break out the family photo albums or some home movies. But...I have to warn you. He wasn't always such a looker.
Stefan: Thank you for stopping by, Elena. Nice to see you.
Elena: Yeah, I should probably go. It was nice to meet you, Damon.
Damon: Great meeting you, too, Elena.


Elena: Stefan....Stefan?


Damon: Great gal. Whoo. She's got spunk. You, on the other hand, look pooped. Did you over-exert yourself today? Let me guess...hospital.
Stefan: Someone had to clean up your mess.
Damon: Well, were you successful? Did the powers of persuasion work? Remember, if you don't feed properly, none of those little tricks work right.
Stefan: How long was Elena here?
Damon: Were you worried, Stefan? Scared we may be doomed to repeat the past? Isn't that why you play your little game, I'm a high school human?
Stefan: I'm not playing any game.
Damon: Of course you are. We both know the closest you'll ever get to humanity is when you rip it open and feed on it.
Stefan: What kind of game are you playing, Damon?
Damon: Guess you'll just have to wait and see, won't you?
Gilbert Residence
Elena: He's on the rebound and has raging family issues.
Jenna: Well, at least it's an ex-girlfriend. Wait till you date a guy with mommy issues or cheating issues. Or amphetamine issues.


Jenna: Jeremy? Jeremy, where were you?
Jeremy: More stoner stories? Look, Jenna, I get it, you were cool. And so that's...that's cool.
Jenna: Oh, no, no, no!


Jeremy: Ow! Why? Why...why did you do that?
Jenna: Listen up! Quit ditching class or you're grounded. No discussion.
Jeremy: Parental authority, I like it. Sleep tight.

Vicki: Matt. Mattie?


Mystic Falls Town Square


Bonnie: Tonight, night of the comet! Would you like a program?


Bonnie: Would you like a program? He didn't call, huh?
Elena: Or text. But I realized we never even exchanged that stuff. We've never gotten to the texting part.
Bonnie: That's an important milestone in any relationship.
Elena: Isn't it? The timing is wrong, anyway.
Bonnie: When is it ever right?
Elena: I'm not ready, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Who is?
Elena: At least I put myself out there.
Bonnie: Is that what you're calling it?
Elena: What do you mean?
Bonnie: All I'm hearing is reasons why you can't.


Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: What is Damon doing here? Why did he come home?
Stefan: 'Cause I came home. He wants to make my life miserable. That's how he enjoys his.
Zach: Well, he's putting us all at risk. This girl in the hospital could talk.
Stefan: She won't. I took care of her.
Zach: You're sure?
Stefan: I'm not sure, Zach. I don't know how well it worked. I'm not as strong as Damon.
Zach: So what happens if it doesn't work?
Stefan: I don't know. I'll deal with it.
Zach: Is she worth it? Uncle Stefan, this girl you came back for?
Mystic Grill
Jeremy: Vicki, what are you doing here?
Vicki: Fighting with Robert about my schedule. You'd think getting ripped up by a rabid animal would merit an extra sick day.
Jeremy: Are you feeling ok?
Vicki: I hurt.
Jeremy: Well, the doctor gave you something, right?
Vicki: The kid stuff. Nothing with an o in it. I think they were on to me.


Jeremy: Here. Knock yourself out, literally.
Vicki: Thanks, Jer.
Jeremy: So you gonna, uh, watch the comet later?
Vicki: I hadn't really thought about it. But I could be talked into it. I'll meet you out there in a few.


Tyler: Hey, Vick. How you feeling?
Vicki: Like you care.


Tyler: What are you lookin' at, Gilbert?
Mystic Falls Town Square
Caroline: Hey, I got some candles.
Elena: Hi. Hey.
Matt: Hey.


Elena: Thank you.
Matt: You're welcome.


Stefan: Thank you. Hi.
Elena: Hi.
Stefan: You know, that comet...it's been traveling across space for thousands of years. All alone.
Elena: Yeah, Bonnie says it's a harbinger of evil.
Stefan: I think it's just a ball of...snow and ice, trapped on a path that it can't escape. And once every 145 years, it gets to come home. I'm sorry about yesterday. I wasn't myself.
Elena: You seem to spend a lot of time apologizing.
Stefan: Well, I have a lot to apologize for. Yesterday, that wasn't about you, ok?
Elena: You didn't tell me that you had a brother.
Stefan: We're not close. It's, uh...it's complicated.
Elena: Always. He told me about your ex. Katherine.
Stefan: What did he say?
Elena: That she broke your heart.
Stefan: That was a long time ago.
Elena: When you lose someone, it stays with you, always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt.
Stefan: Elena...
Elena: It's OK, Stefan. I get it. You have no idea how much I get it. Complicated brother? Check. Complicated ex? Check. Too complicated to even contemplate dating, double check. It's OK. We met, and we talked, and it was epic, but...then the sun came up and reality set in. So...


Mystic Grill


Vicki: I know you.
Damon: Well, that's unfortunate.
Vicki: Um...I don't...I don't know how, but...your face. Excuse me. Sorry.


Jeremy: Hey, has anyone seen Vicki?
Tyler: You're her stalker. You tell us.
Jeremy: I can't find her.
Tyler: She probably found somebody else to party with. Sorry, pill pusher, I guess you've been replaced.
Elena: What's with the pill pusher?
Tyler: Ask him.
Jeremy: You wanna do this right now?
Elena: Are you dealing?
Tyler: She's never gonna go for you.
Jeremy: She already did. Over and over and over again.
Tyler: Yeah, right.
Caroline: You slept with Vicki Donovan? I mean, Vicki Donovan slept with you?
Tyler: There's no way.
Jeremy: And I didn't even have to force her into it.
Matt: What the hell is he talking about, Ty?
Tyler: Nothing, man, just ignore him, he's a punk.
Matt: You know what, how about all of you shut up and help me find my sister?
Bonnie: We'll check the back.
Matt: I'll check the square.
Jeremy: I'll come with you.
Elena: Oh, no, no, no. You are coming with me. So that's your game now, dealing?
Jeremy: I'm not dealing.
Elena: Look, I'm sick of the tough love speech, Jer. It's clearly having no impact.
Jeremy: You and Jenna, between the two of you. Enough already!
Elena: We can stop if you want. Send you to a therapist where you'll be forced to deal with it or to rehab where you'll sit in group and tell some stranger how you let your life fall apart. Or you could talk to me.
Jeremy: I vote for none of the above.

Matt: Hey.
Stefan: Hey.
Matt: Have you seen my sister?
Stefan: No, sorry.
Matt: I can't find her. She's missing.
Stefan: I'll keep an eye out for her.


Matt: Hey. I saw you at the hospital yesterday.
Stefan: Did you?
Matt: What were you doing there?
Stefan: Visiting.
Matt: Visiting? You know, Elena and I, we've known each other for a long time. We might not be together right now, but I look out for her. And I'll always look out for her.


Damon: You really have to stop screaming.
Vicki: No, please, stop. Don't...
Damon: Shh. I got you...
Stefan: Excuse me.




Vicki: No! No!
Damon: Shh, I'm not gonna drop you.
Damon : Not bad. Have you been eating bunnies?
Stefan: Let her go.
Damon: Shh. really? Ok. Damon pulls Vicki to the edge of the roof.
Vicki: No!
Stefan: No, no, no!


Damon: Ugh! Relax.
Vicki: What's happening?
Damon : I don't need her to be dead, but...you might.
Damon : What attacked you the other night?
Vicki: I don't know. An animal.
Damon: Are you sure about that? Think. Think about it. Think really hard. What attacked you?
Vicki: A vampire.
Damon: Who did this to you?
Vicki: You did!
Damon: Wrong!
Stefan: Don't.
Damon: It was Stefan.
Stefan: Don't.
Damon: Come here.


Damon: Stefan Salvatore did this to you.
Vicki: Stefan Salvatore did this to me.
Damon: He's a vampire. A vicious, murderous monster.
Stefan: Please, Damon. Please don't do this.
Damon: If you couldn't fix it before, I don't know what you can do now.


Vicki: Aah!
Damon: Ugh! Your choice of lifestyle has made you weak. A couple of vampire parlor tricks is nothing compared to the power that you could have, that you now need. But you can change that. Human blood gives you that.
Vicki: No!
Damon: You have two choices. You can feed and make her forget. Or you can let her run, screaming vampire through the town square.
Stefan: That's what this is about? You want to expose me?
Damon: No! I want you to remember who you are!
Stefan: Why? So what, so I'll feed? So I'll kill? So I'll remember what it's like to be brothers again? You know what, let her go. Let her tell everyone that vampires have returned to Mystic Falls. Let them chain me up, and let them drive a stake through my heart, because at least I'll be free of you.
Damon: Huh. Huh. Wow. Come here, sweetheart.
Vicki: No!
Damon: It's OK.


Vicki: What happened? Where am I? Oh, I ripped my stitches open. Ugh...
Stefan: You Okay?
Vicki: I took some pills, man. I'm good.


Damon: It's good to be home. Think I might stay a while. This town could use a bit of a wake-up call, don't you think?
Stefan: What are you up to, Damon?
Damon: That's for me to know and for you to...dot dot dot. Give Elena my best.

Matt: She said you found her wandering around.
Stefan: Yeah.
Matt: So, um, thanks.


Caroline: Ugh, it's just so much drama. Ever notice how the druggies are the biggest attention whores?
Bonnie: Yeah.
Stefan: Excuse me. Hi.
Bonnie: Hi.
Stefan: Um, have you guys seen Elena?
Bonnie: I think she went home. I'm gonna give you Elena's cell number and her email. She is big on texting, and you can tell her...I said so.
Stefan: Thank you.


Stefan: You ok?
Bonnie: What happened to you? That's so rude. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Caroline: Yeah, she kind of wigs out. It's like her thing.
Gilbert Residence


Elena: Jer?
Jenna: No, it's me, the hypocrite patrol.
Elena: What are you doing?
Jenna: I've become my worst nightmare. The authority figure who has to violate a 15-year-old's privacy. Jackpot. I see the hiding places haven't gotten any more creative.
Elena: What brought this on?
Jenna: Your ass-hat of a history teacher shamed me good yesterday.
Elena: You got tannered. Been there.
Jenna: Discover the impossible, Ms. Sommers. Got it. Thanks. Like I didn't know I was screwing up.
Elena: You're not screwing up, Aunt Jenna.
Jenna: Yes, I am. You know why? Because I'm not her. She made everything look so easy. You know, high school, marriage, having you. I can't do it. I'm gonna say or do the wrong thing, and he's gonna get worse, and it's gonna be my fault. It's impossible.
Elena: This is just the fear talking. You're a little scared, that's all. We all are. I have to go do something. But are you going to be ok?
Mystic Grill




Caroline: Oh...whoa.
Damon: Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
Caroline: No, it's fine. Um...I was hoping I'd see you again.

Damon: Very much.
Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: Hi.
Elena: Hey.
Stefan: Would you like to come in?
Elena: The comet's actually this way.


Elena: Sorry for barging in. Especially after earlier.
Stefan: No, no. I'm glad you're here. The way we left things...I didn't like it.
Elena: See, the thing is, I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do, write in my diary, like I have been since my mom gave me one when I was 10. It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling. It all goes in this little book that I hide on the second shelf behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid. But then I realized that I'd just be writing things that I should probably be telling you.
Stefan: What would you write?
Elena: I would write...Dear diary, today I convinced myself it was ok to give up. Don't take risks. Stick with the status quo. No drama, now is just not the time. But my reasons aren't reasons, they're excuses. All I'm doing is hiding from the truth, and the truth is that... I'm scared, Stefan. I'm scared that if I let myself be happy for even one moment that...the world's just going to come crashing down, and I...don't know if I can survive that.
Stefan: Do you want to know what I would write? I met a girl. We talked. It was epic. But then the sun came up and reality set in. Well, this is reality. Right here.

Damon: Good morning.

Caroline: Aaah!!!!!!

Mystic Falls High
Bonnie: I'm not saying don't date the guy. I'm just saying take it slow.
Elena: You were the one who said to go for it.
Bonnie: Now I'm saying take it slow.
Elena: Why the about-face?
Bonnie: It's not an about-face. You're single for the first time in your entire high school career. It's the perfect time to play the field.
Elena: Oh, because I'm so that girl. Seriously, what are you not saying?
Bonnie: It's stupid.
Elena: Bonnie...
Bonnie: What?
Elena: Spit it out.
Bonnie: I accidentally touched Stefan. And I got a really bad feeling.
Elena: Is that it? Bonnie.
Bonnie: It was bad bad!
Elena: Is this the whole witch mojo thing again?
Bonnie: You know what? I'm just concerned. This is me expressing concern about my best friend's new boyfriend.
Elena: And I love you for it, I do. But I feel good. It's been a hard year, and I'm starting to kind of feel like things are getting back to normal again. And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that.


Vicki: I rock. I scored 2 tickets to the Posers Saturday night. They're playing at the Rat.
Jeremy: You and Tyler have fun.
Vicki: Don't be like that. Come on. I want you to go.
Jeremy: You're not worried everyone's going to know you're screwing the stoner geek? Oh, wait...everyone already knows.
Vicki: Yeah. But it's not like that anymore, so now we can be friends and just hang.
Jeremy: Tell me something, was it the drugs? Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs?
Vicki: Screw you.
Jeremy: No, if there's another reason, please, I'm all ears.


Stefan: Good morning, Elena. Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline. She's not answering her phone. So I'll see you guys later.


Elena: Bonnie, wait...
Stefan: She doesn't like me very much.
Elena: She doesn't know you. She's my best friend. She's just looking out for me. But when she does, she will love you.


Tyler: Look...there's Elena and her new boyfriend. Now, what are they doing? Oh, they're walking, walking, walking. Yep. Right into the sunset.
Matt: You're a dick.
Tyler: While you just stand there looking like one of those little yard trolls.
Matt: Gnomes.
Elena: Here's what we're going to do. Are you free tonight?
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: Perfect. Dinner, my house. 8:00. You, me, and Bonnie. You two will spend some quality time and she'll get to see what a great guy you are. Mission accomplished.
Matt: Hey, what am I supposed to do, Ty? She made her choice.
Tyler: Let her know she made the wrong one.


Matt: What are you doing? Ty, don't. Ty, don't! Ty!




Elena: That throw was insane. I didn't know you played football.
Stefan: I used to. It was a long time ago.
Elena: So why don't you try out for the team?
Stefan: Yeah, I don't think so.
Elena: So you don't like football?
Stefan: No, I love football. I think it's a great sport. But in this case, I don't think football likes me. You saw Tyler over there, and we both know how Matt feels.
Elena: They don't know you. To them, you're mysterious loner guy. Wouldn't hurt to be part of. Make some friends.
Stefan: Says the girl who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.
Elena: Hey, come on. There's more to me than just gloomy graveyard girl. There's a whole other Elena that you have yet to meet. She was into everything, very busy.
Stefan: Well, I look forward to meeting her. And when will that be?
Elena: Soon. She's working on it.


Tanner: World war II ended in...Anyone got anything? Miss Juan? 1945.
Elena: Psst. FYI...Our team sucks. They could use you.
Stefan: Can't.
Tanner: Pearl Harbor.
Stefan: I'm a loner.
Tanner: Miss Gilbert?
Elena: Hmm?
Tanner: Pearl Harbor?
Elena: Um...
Stefan: December 7, 1941.
Tanner: Thank you, Miss Gilbert.
Stefan: Anytime.
Tanner: Very well. The fall of the Berlin wall.
Stefan: 1989. I'm good with dates, sir.

Tanner: The battle of Gettysburg.
Stefan: 1863.
Tanner: Korean war.
Stefan: 1950 to 1953.
Tanner: Ha! It ended in '52.
Stefan: Uh, actually, sir, it was '53.
Tanner: Look it up, somebody. Quickly.
Student: It was 19...53.


Elena: How did you know all of that?
Stefan: Years and years of crossword puzzles. It's a loner thing.


Matt: Nice job! Nice job!
Tanner: Mr. Lockwood, is there anything you're good at? 'Cause it isn't history, and it sure as hell isn't defending the ball!
Tyler: Yes, coach.
Tanner: Now do it again!


Bonnie: Oh, my God! You're here!
Elena: Yep. I can't be sad girl forever. The only way to get things back to the way they were are to do things that were. Oh, and you're coming to dinner tonight.
Bonnie: I am?
Elena: Mm-hmm. You, me and Stefan. You have to give him a chance.
Bonnie: Tonight's no good. Have you seen Caroline? I texted her like a hundred times.
Elena: Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett! You're going to be there.
Bonnie: Fine. I'll go.
Elena: Good.


Tanner: Varsity trials were last spring, Mr. Salvatore.
Stefan: I wasn't here then, sir.
Tanner: And you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned.
Stefan: Mr. Tanner, I realize that you and I didn't get off to the best start, and I want to apologize for that. I've played football before. Wide receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good.
Tanner: Well, I won't be asking you who won the super bowl in '71.
Stefan: '71 was the...Sorry. I...I understand that, sir.
Tanner: Just to see you get knocked on your ass. Borrow some gear. Go! Before I change my mind. Let's run it again!
Matt: First my girlfriend, now my team?
Tyler: Dude, this is an opportunity. Football's a contact sport. Sometimes people get hurt. Whoo! Ha ha!


Bonnie: Seriously, where is Caroline?
Elena: I don't know. It's not like her.
Bonnie: I'll try her again.


Elena: Uh...
Bonnie: Oh, my God. That must be the mystery guy from the grill.
Elena: That's not a mystery guy. That's Damon Salvatore.
Bonnie: Salvatore, as in Stefan?!
Caroline: I got the other brother. Hope you don't mind. Sorry I'm late, girls. I, uh, was busy. All right, let's start with the double pike herkey hurdler, what do you say? And 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today? Ok? Keep going! Ok. Do it again from the top. And 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.


Matt: Blue 80! Blue 80! Set, hut! Go! Come on, Tyler, cover it! Let's do it.
Tanner: Get it.
Matt: Line up!


Matt: I hate to say it, but he's got skills.
Tyler: I think he needs a buddy pass.
Matt: Really?
Tyler: You don't get to walk on the field and act like you own the place after 5 minutes. Just hang one up there and I'll take care of the rest.


Tanner: Do it again.
Matt: All right, let's huddle up. Set, hut!


Tyler: Oh! Whoo! Welcome to the team, buddy.
Tanner: You gonna live, Salvatore?
Stefan: Yeah.
Tanner: Walk it off, son.
Matt: Hey. That was my bad.
Stefan: It's all right.
Matt: Yeah.
Tanner: All right.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: How were tryouts? Did you make the team? Very Emerson, the way you reveal your soul with so many...adjectives.


Stefan: What are you doing here?
Damon: I've come to apologize. I've been doing some thinking, some soul searching, and...I want us to start over. We need to put the past behind us. You're my little brother, and if you want to live a normal, happy human life, then I want that for you. Maybe I can do it, too. That I can learn to be a non-living living person. Maybe there's hope for both of us.


Stefan: You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon.
Damon: Of course it doesn't. I saw Elena today, BTW. That means by the way. She was at cheerleading practice. She looked so perky in her little short shorts. Just...simmer down, I didn't even go near her. I've got my own cheerleader now. Ooh, that reminds me...I gotta run. I have a date. Sweaty palms. Wish me luck.
Gilbert Residence


Bonnie: You explain it. Last night, I'm watching Nine-o, a commercial breaks come on and I'm like, I bet it's that phone commercial. And sure enough, it's that guy and the girl with the bench, he flies to Paris and he flies back. They take a picture.
Elena: Oh, come on. That commercial's on a constant loop.
Bonnie: Fine. Well, how about this? Today I'm obsessed with numbers. 3 numbers. I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22. How weird is that?
Elena: Maybe we should play the lottery. Have you talked to your Grams?
Bonnie: She's just gonna say it's because I'm a witch. I don't want to be a witch. Do you want to be a witch?
Elena: I don't want to be a witch.


Bonnie: And putting it in a nice bowl isn't fooling anybody.
Elena: Ok, serving spoons. Where are the serving spoons?
Bonnie: Middle drawer on your left.
Elena: Ok, so you've been in this kitchen like a thousand times.
Bonnie: Yeah, that's it.


Elena: Ok, he's here. Don't be nervous. Just be your normal loving self.


Bonnie: Birthday candles.






Elena: Did Tanner give you a hard time today?
Stefan: Well, he let me on the team, so I must have done something right.
Elena: Bonnie, you should have seen Stefan today. Tyler threw a ball right at him, and...
Bonnie: Yeah, I heard.
Elena: Why don't you tell Stefan about your family?
Bonnie: Um, divorced. No mom. Live with my dad.
Elena: No, about the witches. Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches. It's really cool.
Bonnie: Cool isn't the word I'd use.
Stefan: Well, it's certainly interesting. I'm not too versed, but I do know that there's a history of Celtic druids that migrated here in the 1800s.
Bonnie: My family came by way of Salem.
Stefan: Really? Salem witches?
Bonnie: Yeah.
Stefan: I would say that's pretty cool.
Bonnie: Really? Why?
Stefan: Salem witches are heroic examples of individualism and nonconformity.
Bonnie: Yeah, they are.


Elena: I wonder who that could be.


Caroline: Surprise! Bonnie said you were doing dinner, so we brought dessert.
Elena: Oh.
Damon: Hope you don't mind.
Stefan: What are you doing here?
Damon: Waiting for Elena to invite me in.
Elena: Oh, yeah, you can...
Stefan: No, no, no. He can't, uh...he can't stay. Can you, Damon?
Caroline: Get in here.
Stefan: We're just...finishing up.
Elena: It's fine. Just come on in.
Damon: You have a beautiful home, Elena.
Elena: Thank you.


Caroline: I cannot believe that Mr. Tanner let you on the team. Tyler must be seething. But good for you. Go for it.
Damon: That's what I always tell him. You have to engage. You can't just sit there and wait for life to come to you. You have to go get it.
Caroline: Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today. It's only because you missed summer camp. God, I don't know how you're ever going to learn the routines.
Bonnie: I'll work with her. She'll get it.
Caroline: I guess we can put her in the back.
Damon: You know, you don't seem like the cheerleader type, Elena.
Caroline: Oh, it's just 'cause her parents died. Yeah, I mean, she's just totally going through a blah phase. She used to be way more fun. And I say that with complete sensitivity.
Damon: I'm sorry, Elena. I know what it's like to lose both your parents. In fact, Stefan and I have watched almost every single person we've ever cared about die.
Stefan: We don't need to get into that right now, Damon.
Damon: Oh, you know what, you're right, Stef. I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up. Mmm.
Mystic Grill


Vicki: Don't do that. Not while I'm working. I'll see you later.
Tyler: I'll see you later.
Matt: She's my sister and I love her, but sometimes she can really make you work for it.
Jeremy: I find it pretty easy.


Jeremy: All right, I get it. Hit me to impress her. That's...That's real nice.
Tyler: I don't need to impress her. I already won. Now you're dead.
Jeremy: Am I? 'Cause it seems like I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.
Matt: Ty, don't!
Tyler: The next time I see you, Gilbert...
Jeremy: No, next time I see you.
Matt: What are you doin', Vick?
Gilbert Residence


Damon: One more.
Elena: Oh, thank you.


Elena: Nice save.
Damon: I like you. You know how to laugh. And you make Stefan smile, which is something I haven't seen in a very long time.
Elena: Earlier, did you mean...Katherine?
Damon: Mm-hmm.
Elena: How did she die?
Damon: In a fire. Tragic fire.
Elena: Recently?
Damon: It seems like it was yesterday.
Elena: What was she like?
Damon: She was beautiful. A lot like you in that department. She was also very complicated and selfish and at times not very kind, but very sexy and seductive.
Elena: So which one of you dated her first?
Damon: Nicely deduced. Ask Stefan. I'm sure his answer differs from mine. I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.
Elena: Why do you say that?
Damon: Oh, I saw you at practice. You looked miserable.
Elena: You saw that?
Damon: Am I wrong?
Elena: I used to love it. It was fun. Things are different this year. Everything that used to matter doesn't anymore.
Damon: So don't let it. Quit, move on. Problem solved. Ta-da.
Elena: Some things could matter again.
Damon: Maybe. But...seems a little unrealistic to me.
Elena: I'm sorry. About Katherine. You lost her, too.
Bonnie: Hey. Need some help?
Damon: Sure, why not?


Caroline: Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time. You have to understand that they were each other's first. You know, like, from the sandbox.
Stefan: That's a really nice scarf.
Caroline: Mm. Thank you, it's new.
Stefan: Can I see it? I mean, would you mind taking it off?
Caroline: Oh, I can't.
Stefan: Why not? You ok?
Caroline: Um...All I know is that I can't take it off.
Damon: What are you two kids talking about?
Stefan: I was just commenting on her scarf.
Damon: Hmm. Hey, you know, um, Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes. Why don't you go see if you can help?
Caroline: Does it look like I do dishes?
Damon: For me?
Caroline: Hmm...I don't think so.
Damon:  Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.
Caroline: You know what? I'm gonna go see if Elena needs some help in the kitchen.
Damon: Great.


Stefan: They are people, Damon. She's not a puppet. She doesn't exist for your amusement, for you to feed on whenever you want to.
Damon: Sure she does. They all do. They're whatever I want them to be. They're mine for the taking.
Stefan: All right, you've had your fun. You used Caroline, you got to meet Elena, good for you. Now it's time for you to go.
Damon: That's not a problem. Because...I've been invited in, and I'll come back tomorrow night and the following night and I'll do with your little cheerleader whatever I want to do. Because that is what is normal to me.


Elena: Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.
Stefan: Hmm. That makes one of us.
Elena: Come on. Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be...


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: There must be a shred of humanity left inside my brother. Somewhere. I keep hoping. But how do I make him see it? And how do I protect her?


Outside Mystic Falls High School


Elena: Ooh. Look at you. You look hot in your jersey.
Stefan: What happened? No more cheerleader?
Elena: I quit. I'm a quitter.
Stefan: No, hey, you're not a quitter. You suffered a great loss. You're not the same person. You should be looking ahead. You should be starting over. Ok? I hope you don't think this is too soon or too weird, but...I, uh, I wanted you to have this.


Elena: Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
Stefan: It's something that I've had forever, and, uh, I've never wanted to give it to anyone until now. I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me, for...good luck.
Elena: Is that rose that I smell?
Stefan: No, it's, uh...it's an herb. It's nice, huh?
Elena: I love it.


Stefan: And, uh, I wanted to thank you for pushing me to try out for the team. It feels really good.
Elena: We're a pair. I quit, you start.
Stefan: Right. We're a work in progress. We'll figure it out.


Caroline: And you're not in uniform because...


Tanner: Wait, wait, wait, Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Let's be honest here. In the past, we used to let other teams come into our town and roll right over us!  We've got some great new talent tonight starting on the offense, and I'm gonna tell you right now, it has been a long time since I have seen a kid like this with hands like these. Let's give it up for Stefan Salvatore!
Tyler: This blows. He can't start the guy. He just got here.
Tanner: That have been waiting for us to put a check in the win column, I have only one thing to say to you...Your Timberwolves are hungry.


Vicki: Hey, babe. What's wrong?
Tyler: Nothing.
Tanner: And the central high lions are what's for dinner!
Tyler: Is that Jeremy?
Vicki: Wait, no! Ty! No. Leave him alone.
Tyler: Oh, what do you care? Don't look so down. You can have her when I'm done.


Vicki: Tyler, stop it! Tyler! Tyler, stop! Stop it! Stop, you're hurting him! Tyler! Tyler, stop! Tyler! Stop it! Tyler, stop!


Stefan: Hey, he's down! Enough!




Elena: Jeremy, no!
Matt: Tyler, knock it off! Stop!


Elena: What the hell, Jeremy? Put your head up, you're bleeding.
Jeremy: I'm fine!
Elena: Yeah, you smell fine.
Jeremy: Just stop, ok?
Matt: Come on, man. Come on.
Elena: Oh, my God, your hand.


Stefan: No, no, no, it's fine.
Elena: Is it deep? How bad is it? Come on!


Elena: But...I saw it, it was...
Stefan: He missed. It's not my blood. See? I'm fine.
Elena: No, no, no. I...I saw it. The glass cut your hand. It was...
Stefan: It's ok. I'm ok. It's almost kick-off time, all right? So, um, I'll, uh, I'll see you after the game.


Caroline: Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly. Can you stand straight, please? Could someone please help Tiki?
Bonnie: Hey! Where you been?
Elena: Can I ask you a question and you give me a really serious no-joke response?
Bonnie: Of course. What is it?
Elena: The bad mojo. When you touched Stefan and you had that reaction...
Bonnie: You know what, forget I said that. Your little dinner party plot totally won me over.
Elena: No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it? Did you see something, Or...
Bonnie: It wasn't clear like a picture. Like today, I keep seeing those same numbers I told you about...8, 14, 22.
Elena: Yeah?
Bonnie: When I touched Stefan, it was a feeling. And it vibrated through me, and it was cold, and it...
Elena: And what?
Bonnie: It was death. It's what I imagine death to be like.


Elena: You scared me. What are you doing here?
Damon: I'm hiding from Caroline.
Elena: And why is that?
Damon: I needed a break. She talks more than I can listen.
Elena: That could be a sign.
Damon: Well, she's awfully young.
Elena: Not much younger than you are.
Damon: I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture. I think she'd drive me crazy.
Elena: Caroline does have some really annoying traits, but we've been friends since the first grade and that means something to me.
Damon: Duly noted. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable. That's not my intention.
Elena: Yes, it is. Otherwise you wouldn't put an alternate meaning behind everything you say.
Damon: You're right. I do have other intentions, but so do you.
Elena: Really?
Damon: Mm-hmm. I see 'em. You want me.
Elena: Excuse me?
Damon: I get to you. You find yourself drawn to me. You think about me even when you don't want to think about me. I bet you even dreamed about me. And right now...You want to kiss me.


Elena: What the hell? I don't know what game you're trying to play with Stefan here, but I don't want to be part of it. And I don't know what happened in the past, but let's get one thing straight...I am not Katherine.


Matt: You gonna be able to play?
Stefan: Oh, yeah, I'm good.
Matt: Uh, what you did back there...you had Jeremy's back.
Stefan: Ah, he's a messed-up kid. Somebody's gotta look out for him.
Matt: I know. This week at practice I was a dick.
Stefan: Had your reasons.
Matt: No excuse.  Good luck tonight. We're lucky to have you.


Damon: Isn't that nice? Stefan joins a team, makes a friend. It's all so, rah, rah, go team, yeah!
Stefan: Not tonight. I'm done with you.
Damon: Nice trick with Elena. Let me guess...vervain in the necklace? I admit, I was a bit surprised. It's been a while since anyone could resist my compulsion. Where'd you get it?
Stefan: Does it matter?
Damon: Guess I could just seduce her the old-fashioned way. Or I could just...eat her.
Stefan: No. You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.
Damon: No?
Stefan: Because deep down inside, there is a part of you that feels for her. I was worried that you had no humanity left inside of you, that you may have actually become the monster that you pretend to be.
Damon: Who's pretending?
Stefan: Then kill me.
Damon: Well, I'm...I'm tempted.
Stefan: No, you're not. You've had lifetimes to do it, and yet, here I am. I'm still alive. And there you are. You're still haunting me. After 145 years. Katherine is dead. And you hate me because you loved her, and you torture me because you still do. And that, my brother, is your humanity.
Tanner: Salvatore! What the hell? We've got a game to play!
Damon: If that's my humanity...then what's this?


Tanner: Aah!
Stefan: No!
Damon: Anyone, anytime, any place.


Tyler: Tanner's M.I.A. I think he had a little bit too much beer.
Matt: Don't talk to me right now, all right? I'm pissed at you.
Tyler: What's your problem?
Matt: What's my...You're my problem, all right? You're a bully. A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man. And I'm sick of it. I mean, what was that about tonight? What's beating up the new guy going to prove? Or screwing with my sister or pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother.
Tyler: Girlfriend? Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but she dumped your ass. Are you for real?! You want to hit me? I'm on your team.
Matt: This was over the line. Even for you.


Matt: Somebody help!




Vicki: It wasn't just for the drugs.


Elena: What kind of animal could be doing all this? Why would it come out of the woods and attack someone in the middle of town?
Stefan: I don't know. I don't know.
Elena: I was so sure that you cut your hand. I saw it.
Stefan: I'm fine. I'm fine, ok? We're fine. That's what matters.


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: I thought there was hope that somewhere deep inside, something in Damon was still human, normal. But I was wrong. There's nothing human left in Damon. No good, no kindness. No love. Only a monster Who must be stopped.
Gilbert Residence


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Hello? Jeremy? Hello?


Logan : This is Logan Fell coming to you live from the streets of Mystic Falls with breaking news of another deadly animal attack. The wild animal terrorizing the citizens of Mystic Falls has claimed another victim, local high school student Elena Gilbert. Police are certain that forensic evidence will confirm that this is the same animal responsible for recent attacks.
Damon: You know what's coming next.


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: Ahh!
Damon: Bad dream? Do you know how easy it was to get into your head just now? You really need some human blood. It might even the playing field. Football reference. Too soon.


Damon: All right, I deserved that. But I just wanted to let you know, they caught the culprit. The animal responsible for killing coach Tanner and all those people.
Stefan: What are you talking about?
Damon: It was a mountain lion. Really big one. It attacked a hunter this morning. It's all over the news. Deadly beast captured. All's well in Mystic Falls.
Stefan: Why would you cover your tracks?
Damon: I've decided to stay a while. And I'm just having way too much fun here with you and Elena.
Stefan: Can't touch her now.
Damon: Well, the vervain keeps me out of her head. Maybe that's not my target. Believe it or not, Stefan, some girls don't need my persuasion. Some girls just can't resist my good looks, my style and my charm and my unflinching ability to listen to Taylor Swift.


Damon: This is John Varvatos, dude. Dick move.




Sheriff Forbes : I can confirm that a 12-foot puma mountain lion attacked a hunter and was subsequently shot and killed. The hunter is in stable condition.
Stefan: The real animal is still out there, waiting for me, challenging me to fight back, to stop him. But how do I stop a monster without becoming one myself?
Gilbert Residence
Logan : To repeat, the animal terrorizing Mystic Falls has been caught.
Jenna: Scum ball. Scum bucket.
Elena: Who are you talking to?
Jenna: Him.
Elena: The news guy?
Jenna: Also known as Logan Scum Fell. Did your mom ever tell you why I moved away from Mystic Falls?
Elena: Oh, no way. You and him? He's cute.
Jenna: He is not cute. There's nothing cute about him. What are you doing with that?
Elena: I went yesterday and got it from the safe deposit box. Mom had told Mrs. Lockwood she would loan it to the founder's council for their heritage display.
Jenna: Is that grandma Beth's wedding ring?
Elena: Originally it was great-great-grandma Mary's wedding ring.
Jeremy: How much do you think this stuff is worth? You know, like on eBay?
Elena: You're not gonna find out.
Jeremy: That stuff is mom and dad's. You can't just give it away.
Elena: I'm not giving it away. It's called a loan, Jeremy.


Stefan: Hi.


Elena: Hi.




Elena: Are you okay?
Stefan: I'm good. Sorry.
Elena: Maybe we should press pause.
Stefan: Yeah, you're probably right. That was getting a bit...
Elena: Yeah.
Stefan: Yeah.
Elena: How do you look in a suit?
Stefan: I can pull one off.
Elena: How about tomorrow night? Will you be my date to the Founder's Party?
Stefan: They still do that?
Elena: Have you been before?
Stefan: No, the Salvatores don't get invited anymore.
Elena: Well, this year, there's this heritage project that meant a lot to my mom. She was really involved in the founder's council, and it was her favorite party. I know it sounds really boring, but, 
Stefan: I would be honored to accompany you, Miss Gilbert.
Elena: The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Salvatore.
Forbes Residence


Damon: No yellow. Jaundice. Go for the blue.
Caroline: I don't like the blue.
Damon: Well, I do. And if I'm gonna be your date, 
Caroline: You cannot be my date. My mother is going to be there, and she is a very proud gun owner.
Damon: I went through a lot of trouble to make sure this party wasn't cancelled. It's very important I be there. Please take me.
Caroline: You should come to the founder's party with me.
Damon: Not if you're wearing that dress. What's so special about this Bella girl? Edward's so whipped.
Caroline: You gotta read the first book first. It won't make sense if you don't.
Damon: Ah, I miss Anne Rice. She was so on it.
Caroline: How come you don't sparkle?
Damon: Because I live in the real world, where vampires burn in the sun.
Caroline: Yeah, but you go in the sun.
Damon: I have a ring. It protects me. Long story.
Caroline: Will these bites turn me into a vampire?
Damon: It's more complicated than that. You'd have to feed on my blood, then die, then feed on a human's,it's a whole ordeal. This book, by the way has it all wrong.


Caroline: You can be very sweet when you want to be.
Damon: Yes, I can be sweet.
Caroline: Are you going to kill me?
Damon: Mm-hmm. But not yet.
Caroline: Why not?
Damon: Because there's something I need you to do for me.
Caroline: Anything.
Damon: How good are you at getting this little nose where it doesn't belong?
Caroline: Oh, I'm excellent.
Damon: Mmm.
Mystic Grill


Mr Lockwood: So what happens with the season? One big forfeit? Are they looking for a new coach?
Tyler: I don't know, dad. I doubt anybody's thinking about that right now.
Mrs Lockwood: Charles, founder's party, focus.
Vicki: How are y'all doing over here?
Mr Lockwood: Ah, we're doing great, sweetheart.
Vicki: Is there anything else I can get you?
Tyler: We're fine, thanks.
Mr Lockwood: Just the check, honey.
Vicki: Here you go, Mayor Lockwood.
Mr Lockwood: Thanks.


Bonnie: You're taking Damon to the founder's party? What about me?
Caroline: Go with Elena.
Bonnie: She's asking Stefan.
Caroline: Okay, go by yourself.
Bonnie: Gee, thanks. What about your mom? Is she okay with you bringing Damon?
Caroline: And I'm supposed to care why?
Bonnie: He's older sexy danger guy.
Caroline: Older sexy danger guy? Is that an official witch twitter tweet?
Bonnie: No more witch jokes, okay? That whole Mr. Tanner prediction thing has me freaked.
Caroline: Okay. And Damon's not dangerous. You know, he just has a lot of issues with his brother. You know, like major, deep-rooted drama.
Bonnie: Like...?
Caroline: I'm not really supposed to say anything.
Bonnie: Caroline Forbes, when have you ever kept a secret in your life?
Caroline: Okay. But you can't tell Elena.
Bonnie: No.
Tyler: So what you gonna buy me?
Vicki: Ugh, some class. Oh, your parents are gone. I guess we can be close now.
Tyler: What the hell does that mean?
Vicki: You treat me like trash. I'm sick of it.
Tyler: I don't think you're trash.
Vicki: Really? Then who are you taking to the founder's party?
Tyler: Vicki Donovan. Do you want me to ask you to the founder's party?
Vicki: No. It'll be stupid and lame.
Tyler: True. But it'll be less stupid and lame if you were there.


Jeremy: You realize you had to ask him to ask you, right? You figure if you dress up like a respectable young lady, he'll finally treat you like one?
Vicki: Screw you, Jeremy.
Jeremy: You know you're making the wrong choice, yet you make it anyway. It's sad.
Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: I didn't know you were here.
Damon: Just going through Stefan's homework. Boy, this country sure has dumbed down in the last hundred years. Why he wants to go to high school is beyond me. I mean, in the seventies, he went Ivy League. Harvard, I understood. Actually, no. I didn't get that either. Go ahead, purge. Get it out. What's on your mind?
Zach: Why are you here, Damon?
Damon: To spend time with you, Zach. Family's important.
Zach: I know you. You always have a motive. So tell me, what is it this time?


Damon: You are in no position to question me.
Zach: I didn't mean to upset you.
Damon: This is not upset, Zach.
Stefan: What's going on?


Damon: Having a family moment, Stefan. Spending some quality time.
Stefan: Hey, are you okay?
Zach: No, I'm not. And neither are you. How many more people have to die before you see that?
Stefan: I see it. All right, Zach, I see it.
Zach: Then why aren't you doing anything about it?
Stefan: I can't, Zach. I can't. It would take human blood. It's the only way that I could stop him, and I can't do that.
Zach: The vervain could weaken him if he ingested it. It would help get you the upper hand.
Stefan: Vervain hasn't grown here since 1865. Damon saw to that. The little I had, I gave to Elena. What?


Stefan: You've been growing it.
Zach: It's just something that's been passed down through the generations. Blood only runs so deep when you're related to vampires. Damon would kill me if he knew that I had it.
Stefan: But you're telling me. Why?
Zach: Because I trust you. And you're gonna need it if you want to get rid of him.
Gilbert Residence


Tyler: I'm here for my mom. I was supposed to pick up a box of stuff.
Elena: Right here. Please be careful.
Jeremy: Yeah, be careful with it, dick.
Elena: Hey! Not now, okay, guys? Please?
Tyler: I'm fine. He's just being a punk.
Jeremy: I got your punk.
Elena: Look, Tyler, maybe you should go. Tell your mom that I'll see her tonight.
Tyler: Hey. Would it make a difference if I told you I actually like Vicki?
Jeremy: Not even if you meant it.


Bonnie: Delicate flower vs. naughty vixen.
Elena: Tough call. Can we mix them?
Bonnie: Look at you, getting all pretty for your date. You seem happy-ish.
Elena: I am...ish. Tonight's going to be a good night. But don't let that stop you from telling me whatever it is you wanted to tell me as soon as you walked in the door.
Bonnie: What if I tell you in the morning? I don't want to ruin the night.
Elena: Bonnie, out with it.
Bonnie: Okay, but it has to go in the vault, because Caroline will kill me if it gets back to Damon that she squealed. Apparently Stefan has a very interesting back story.
Elena: Uh-huh.
Bonnie: Do you know what happened with his ex-girlfriend Katherine?
Elena: I know that they both dated her and that's why they have issues.
Bonnie: Yeah, they both dated her, only she chose Damon. And that drove Stefan mad, so he did horrible things to try and break them up. He manipulated Katherine. He filled her head with all these lies until finally it worked, and she turned against Damon.
Elena: That sounds like one person's side of the story, meaning Damon's.
Bonnie: I just wanted you to know.
Elena: Anyway, his past relationships are none of my business.
Bonnie: Unless he's a calculating, manipulative liar. That is your business.
Elena: Stefan is none of those things.
Bonnie: Yeah? How do you know?
Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: Do they still wear ties at this thing?
Stefan: Why are you even going?
Damon: It's only fitting. We were at the very first one, remember?
Stefan: I think it's better if we don't draw attention to ourselves.
Damon: So you should stay here. I'll see to it Elena has a good time. My goodness, I've driven you to drink.
Stefan: Can't seem to rid myself of you. What else am I supposed to do, besides go about living my life?
Damon: Go about living my life. See, therein lies your eternal struggle. You're dead, dude. Get over it. What do you think?
Gilbert Residence


Elena: Hello? Hi, Mrs. Lockwood. What do you mean? It is? Are you sure? 'Cause I saw it. Let me check. Mm-hmm. I will find it and bring it. Ok. Bye.
Bonnie: What's wrong?


Jeremy: Ahh! God, what now?
Elena: The pocket watch. Where is it?
Jeremy: What watch?
Elena: The one you stole from mom's box. Look, Mrs. Lockwood just called me, freaking out. It was on the list, Jeremy. And she can't find it, and she thinks she's the one who lost it.
Jeremy: Maybe she did. Maybe Tyler took it.
Elena: Don't even play that card. Jeremy, you took it. If I go online, am I going to find it on eBay? Is that how you pay for your pot?
Jeremy: Screw you.  I would never sell this, ok?
Elena: Then why did you take it?
Jeremy: Because it's supposed to be mine. Dad said it goes to the firstborn son. His father gave it to him, and now what?


Elena: And he was going to give it to you.
Jeremy: Yeah.
Elena: Look, Jeremy, it's still yours, okay? Mom promised Mrs. Lockwood. What do you want me to do?
Jeremy: Just take it and get out.
Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: It's cool not growing old. I like being the eternal stud.
Stefan: Yes, being a 150-year-old teenager has been the height of my happiness.
Damon: You cracked a funny, Stefan. I should have a drink to celebrate. 1864. You and Katherine were the perfect couple. It was hell watching you dance with her.
Stefan: My happiness was short-lived, as you well know.
Damon: I remember. I left the party early, I was waiting for her. The night you dropped her off, I was waiting just inside. You were such a gentleman, gave her a kiss on the cheek. And what she really wanted was...Oh, well. Here's to history repeating itself, huh?


Damon: I admire your effort, Stefan. Pouring yourself a drink then spiking the bottle with vervain. I'm not some drunk sorority chick. You can't roofie me. But I can't help but feel a little used. I thought we were having a moment. I have to go to the party angry. Who knows what I'll do?
Lockwood Residence


Tyler: Uh, let's go this way.
Vicki: Why?
Tyler: Line's too long. We can go around back. Come on, party's in the back.
Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: That was his favorite scotch. I'm sorry, I thought it would work.
Stefan: I wasn't counting on it.
Zach: You knew it would fail?
Stefan: Did what I wanted. It lowered his guard. He won't expect me to try again so soon.
Zach: I doubled what I put in the scotch.

Lockwood Residence
Mrs Lockwood: Caroline! You look smashing.
Caroline: Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood. This is my boyfriend Damon.
Mrs Lockwood: Oh, well, come on in.
Damon: Lovely to meet you. I've been looking forward to this party for quite a while.
Mrs Lockwood: Well, enjoy.
Damon: Let's get a drink.
Caroline: Wait here.


Caroline: Really, you couldn't even change out of the badge for this?
Sheriff Forbes: I'm working, honey. Who's the date you just tried to sneak past me?
Caroline: Just some guy.
Sheriff Forbes: He's a little old for you, don't you think?
Caroline: Oh, 'cause otherwise you'd approve. Yeah, I doubt that.


Elena: Hi, Mayor Lockwood
Mr Lockwood: Hey. Hey, guys, come on in.
Stefan: Thank you.
Sheriff Forbes: Where's your dad?
Caroline: Memphis.
Sheriff Forbes: Good.
Caroline: With Steven.




Stefan: Your parents?
Elena: There's a lot of history here.


Logan: Jenna.
Jenna: Hello Logan.
Logan: It's good to see you.
Jenna: I thought I might see you here.
Logan: You knew it.
Jenna: I dreaded.
Logan: But were secretly hoping.
Jenna: And now that I have...
Logan: Whoa, hey, not so fast. I know you. You have a lot more insults in you, I can tell.
Jenna: Your hairline's receding.
Logan: No, it's not. You want to have lunch?
Jenna: Nope.
Logan: You haven't changed a bit.
Jenna: Oh, yes, I have. I'm meaner now.


Elena: The founding families in Mystic Falls welcomes you to the inaugural founder's council celebration. Wow, look, it's the original guest registry. Look at all these familiar names, Sheriff William Forbes, Mayor Benjamin Lockwood. Is that Damon Salvatore? And, Stefan Salvatore?
Damon: The original Salvatore brothers. Our ancestors. Tragic story, actually.
Stefan: We don't need to bore them with stories of the past.
Elena: It's not boring, Stefan. I'd love to hear more about your family.
Caroline: Well, I'm bored. I want to dance. And Damon won't dance with me.
Damon: Mm-hmm.
Caroline: Could I just borrow your date?
Elena: Oh, uh...
Stefan: I don't really dance.
Damon: Oh, sure he does. You should see him. Waltz, the jitterbug, the moonwalk. He does it all.
Caroline: You wouldn't mind, would you, Elena?
Elena: It's up to Stefan.
Caroline: Well sorry, but I'm not going to take no for an answer.


Damon: I want to apologize to you for being such a world-class jerk the other night when I tried to kiss you. There's no excuse. My therapist says I'm...Acting out, trying to punish Stefan.
Elena: For what?
Damon: It's all in the past. I don't even want to bring it up. Let's just say that the men in the Salvatore family have been cursed with sibling rivalry. And it all started with the original Salvatore brothers.
Stefan: Damon told you to ask me to dance. Didn't he?
Caroline: Now why would he do that?
Stefan: Would you like one?


Stefan: Thank you.
Caroline: Okay, just tell me if you see my mom.
Damon: The Salvatore name was practically royalty in this town. Until the war. There was a battle here, 
Elena: The Battle of Willow Creek.
Damon: Right.
Elena: I know, we talked about it in class. Confederate soldiers fired on a church with civilians inside.
Damon: What the history books left out was the people that were killed. They weren't there by accident. They were believed to be union sympathizers. So some of the founders on the confederacy side back then wanted them rounded up and burned alive. Stefan and Damon had someone they loved very much in that church. And when they went to rescue them, they were shot. Murdered in cold blood.
Elena: Who was in the church that they wanted to save?
Damon: A woman, I guess. Doesn't it always come down to the love of a woman?
Elena: Look, I'm sorry that you and Stefan have this thing between you, but I can't get in the middle of it, Damon. I just...I hope you two can work it out.
Damon: I hope so, too.


Vicki: So you want to dance?
Tyler: Me dancing? Not pretty.
Vicki: Maybe you could show me around. I mean, this place is amazing.
Tyler: Yeah, if you like living in a museum.
Vicki: Maybe I should just strip naked and give Pastor Bill a lap dance. I mean, that's why we're hiding in a corner all night, isn't it? You're scared of how I'm going to act? You afraid of what your parents are going to think about your date from the wrong side of the tracks?
Tyler: I don't care about what they think.
Vicki: Great. Let's go say hi.
Tyler: Knock it off, Vick.
Vicki: Or we could just, you know, sneak up to your bedroom. As long as nobody sees us, right?
Tyler: Vicki, I swear...
Vicki: What's a matter, Ty? You scared to stand up to your mommy? It's pretty pathetic.
Tyler: Let go!
Mrs Lockwood: Tyler...We didn't get a chance to say hello earlier. It's Vicki, right? Matt's sister.
Vicki: Yes, ma'am.
Mrs Lockwood: You'll have to forgive my son's rudeness. He gets it from his father.
Vicki: Well, that's okay, Mrs. Lockwood. Tyler and I were just saying good night.
Mrs Lockwood: That's what you get when you bring the trash into the party.




Damon: What'd we miss?
Stefan: We were just chatting. Drink, Damon?
Damon: No, thanks, I'll pass.
Elena: Stefan, do you have another dance in you?
Stefan: Absolutely.


Caroline: They look so cute together.
Damon: Don't talk, please.


Logan: Don't shoot! Only need a refill.
Jenna: Shooting implies caring.
Logan: Feigned indifference. I like it.
Jenna: I'm over the banter, Logan. I'd really rather you just left me alone.
Logan: I'm sorry, Jenna. About your sister.
Jenna: Thank you.
Logan: I Came to the funeral.
Jenna: I know. I saw you.
Logan: Yeah, I didn't want to push my way in, but I wanted to be there for you. And when I heard you were staying in Mystic Falls, I thought maybe...Well, maybe I could have a second chance to make things right.
Jenna: Her name was Monica, wasn't it?


Stefan: I hope Damon didn't drive you too crazy.
Elena: No, actually, he was on good behavior. He even apologized and explained why he is the way he is. And it all goes back to Katherine.
Stefan: Hmm.
Elena: So tell me about her. What happened?
Stefan: It's not something I like to talk about.
Elena: I get that. I do. I just want you to know that you can. I mean, I burden you with all of my drama, and I want you to do the same.
Stefan: I know. Thank you.
Elena: The truth is, Stefan...I don't really know that much about you, and I'd really love it if you would open up to me.


Stefan: Damon said something, didn't he? He likes to play games and cause trouble, Elena.
Elena: This isn't about Damon, it's about me trying to get to know you. Look, you're the mystery guy, and I like that. But with mystery comes secrets, and this thing with Katherine.
Stefan: Let it go. I don't want to talk about it.
Elena: Well, then, say something about yourself. Anything. Otherwise, I'm left with nothing but what other people tell me.
Stefan: Don't you see what Damon has done here? He's trying to get you to turn against me.
Elena: Well, then I guess it's working.




Bonnie: This is my fault. I planted doubt. I'm a doubt planter.
Elena: It's not your fault. I just, I feel terrible because I said that I wouldn't get in the middle of it, and then that's exactly what I did. I got all snotty.
Mrs Lockwood: Elena, honey, there you are. I notice the watch still isn't in the collection.
Elena: Oh, um, I'm sorry, Mrs. Lockwood. I, um, I couldn't find it. I guess it's still packed up in my parents' stuff somewhere.
Mrs Lockwood: I see. Well, please let me know if you do find it.
Elena: OK.


Caroline: Where have you been?
Damon: Ah. Looking for you.
Caroline: Your brother barely danced with me for five minutes, 
Damon: Okay, just a minute. Stand right...there.


Caroline: Um, you're not supposed to touch. What is that?


Damon: A very important crystal.
Caroline: Well, how did you know that it was there?
Damon: Because I put it there.
Caroline: When?
Damon: A long time ago. Tonight, I'm taking it back, thanks to you.
Caroline: Well, what's it for?
Damon: Never you mind.
Caroline: Well, you can't just steal it.
Damon: It's not stealing if it's mine. Come on.
Caroline: Well...


Logan: Vodka tonic. Okay, I know that this is probably going to be strike 3, but I hope you can see it for what it is.
Jenna: And what is it?
Logan: Persistence, groveling, commitment. Take your pick.
Jenna: I fled town because of you. Fled.
Logan: I was young and stupid, and then things changed. Life got...real. You'd know that better than anyone.
Jenna: Hypothetically speaking, if allowed, how would you make things right?
Logan: Well, more groveling, of course. A recap of the past few years spent soul searching. Cheese fries.
Jenna: Obvious.
Logan: I know my audience.
Jenna: Yes to lunch. Call me.


Mrs Lockwood: Look around. What's missing? The flames, the candles. Why aren't they lit? There's matches in the kitchen.
Bonnie: Bitch.




Elena: Hey.
Caroline: Hey. So how are things with Stefan?
Elena: Great. Just great.
Caroline: Really? Well, my radar must be off, 'cause I was getting all sorts of other vibes...


Elena: What is that?
Caroline: Hmm?  Don't!


Elena: Oh god, Caroline, what happened?
Caroline: Nothing, okay?!
Elena: That is not nothing! Did somebody hurt you?
Caroline: No, okay, nothing. It just...My mom would kill me.


Elena: Did Damon hurt you?
Caroline: No! Of course not! Just leave me alone. Okay, Elena?!


Elena: There is something seriously wrong with you. You stay away from Caroline or I will go straight to her mother, the sheriff. You got it? Stay away from her.


Elena: I'm sorry. I take it all back. You're completely right about Damon.
Stefan: What did he do?
Elena: There are bruises all over Caroline's body. Bite marks, and he has her all confused and messed up in the head. You don't look surprised.
Stefan: Um...I'm handling it.
Elena: Handling it? Stefan, you should be having him arrested.
Stefan: Elena, please. I...I don't expect you to understand.
Elena: I don't understand anything, Stefan. So why don't you just clear it up for me?
Stefan: Look, there are things that you don't know, okay? Things that I want to tell you, but I can't. And I may never be able to. And I just need you to trust me.
Elena: Trust is earned. I can't just magically hand it over.


Stefan: I'm so sorry. I have to go.
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: You look amazing. What are you doing here?
Vicki: I was thinking maybe I could make one more wrong choice today. I still have 17 minutes.


Lockwood Residence


Caroline: Don't! She took it off and I got flustered, okay?! I didn't know what to say. But I swear, okay? I did not tell her. I just told her that you didn't mean to hurt me.


Damon: You make me crazy, you know that? It's okay. I forgive you.
Caroline: I swear I didn't say, 
Damon: Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. Unfortunately...I am so over you now.


Damon: What the hell?
Stefan: You know, I couldn't spike your drink...So I spiked hers.


Elena: Caroline? There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. Are you okay?
Caroline: Yeah. I'm fine.
Elena: Caroline, what happened?
Caroline: I'm fine.
Elena: No. You're shaking. Caroline, What, 
Caroline: I'm fine!
Elena: Caroline, come here, come here.


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: I did what I had to do...To protect Elena, to protect everyone. Yes, Damon, the headline reads Deadly beast captured. All is well in Mystic Falls.
Lockwood Residence
Mr Lockwood: Thank you for staying so late.
Sheriff Forbes: Did you get the Gilbert watch?
Mrs Lockwood: She claims it's packed away in her parents' things.
Logan: I can get it.
Sheriff Forbes: Good. We're going to need it.
Mr Lockwood: Are you sure?
Sheriff Forbes: Five bodies all drained of blood? I'm certain.
Logan: They've come back.

Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Where is my ring?
Stefan: Won't be needing it anymore.
Damon: How long have I been here?
Stefan: Three days.
Damon: What are you doing?
Stefan: During the dark ages when a vampire's actions threatened to expose or bring harm upon the entire race, they would face judgment. They sought to reeducate them rather than to punish them.
Damon: You know what will happen if I don't...feed on blood.
Stefan: You'll grow weaker and weaker. Eventually you won't be able to move or speak. In a week your skin will desiccate, and you'll mummify. A living corpse. Unable to hurt anyone. Ever.
Damon: So what, you're just going to leave me in the basement, forever?
Stefan: I've injected you with enough vervain to keep you weak. Once your circulation stops, I'll move you to the family crypt, and then in 50 years, we can reevaluate.
Damon: I'm stronger than you think.
Stefan: You always have been. But you're not stronger than the vervain. And we both know it. I'm sorry. Didn't have to be this way.

Gilbert Residence


Vicki: I--I'm sorry, I'm almost done.
Elena: It's--it's ok. Take your time.


Vicki: I think you might be in trouble.
Jeremy: What did you do?
Vicki: Oh, Elena saw me.
Jeremy: I'm a drug-using delinquent. A girl in bed doesn't really rank. Sorry.


Elena: Jenna! Are you aware of what's going on upstairs?
Jenna: Uh-huh.
Elena: And you have no objection?
Jenna: He could be craftier about it, at least make an effort to sneak her in and out. Oh, and just so you know, I won't be home for dinner.
Elena: Oh, so you're actually going to do it. You're gonna go out with Logan.
Jenna: I'm going to show up and torture him, yes. And have you heard from Stefan?
Elena: Not since he left that very vague message three days ago. Hi, um, Elena, I, um, have something I have to do. I'll, uh, explain in a few days.
Jenna: Haven't you called him?
Elena: Nope. Not going to either.
Jenna: And you're ok with everything?
Elena: No, I'm not ok with any of it. But I'm not gonna cry about it, either. You know, I was going to write in my diary this morning and then I thought, what am I going to write? Honestly, I'm not gonna be one of those pathetic girls whose world stops spinning because of some guy.
Jenna: Ok, then.
Elena: I'll be fine.
Salvatore Boarding House
Stefan: He's awake. He's weak, but it's probably best to stay out of the basement. He's Damon. I'm not sure how dangerous he still might be.
Zach: You're going to school?
Stefan: Came here to live a life. It's about time I get back to that. And Elena, if she's still speaking to me.
Zach: Why haven't you called her?
Stefan: What am suppose to do, feed her another lie? I hate lying to her, Zach. I'm not good at it. She already thinks I'm hiding something.
Zach: What choice do you have? You came here because you wanted to live as normal a life as you could. You knew this was going to be a part of it.
Forbes Residence


Caroline: I remember the party. Damon came up behind me, and he was kissing my neck, or biting my neck. I passed out. It's like there's holes in my memory lately. It's just weird. Maybe I let him bite me.
Bonnie: Why would you do that?
Caroline: Can we just not talk about it, ok? Don't want to talk about Damon. I don't want to talk about any of it. Just want to go back to normal. What are you doing with that candle?
Bonnie: Um...nothing. What's this?


Caroline: Damon gave it to me. Or he was going to give it to me. All I know is, it's mine now.
Bonnie: It's ugly.
Caroline: Well, get your grubby hands off it.
Mystic Falls High School
Caroline: The sexy suds car wash is tomorrow. The football team and the band have committed. Well, not all the band. Just the ones who could pull off the bikini. I want, in your face, sexy. I mean, it's a fund raiser, for god's sake.
Elena: Unbelievable. It's like nothing happened.
Bonnie: She's in denial.
Stefan: Hey.
Bonnie: Hey. You know, I gotta go. Be somewhere right now.
Stefan: I'm so sorry I haven't called.
Elena: No worries. I'll live.
Stefan: I was dealing with Damon.
Elena: And did you...deal with Damon?
Stefan: Yes. Yeah.
Elena: For four days?
Stefan: You have every right to be upset with me. But can I explain it all to you? Please.
Elena: Sure. When?
Stefan: I gotta be home after school, but The Grill, around four o'clock?
Elena: Ok.
Stefan: Thanks.
Caroline: Stefan, where is Damon? He has some serious apologizing to do.
Stefan: He's gone, Caroline.
Caroline: When is he coming back?
Stefan: He's not coming back. I'm sorry.
Elena: This is a good thing, Caroline.
Caroline: I know that.
Mystic Grill
Elena: Hey, Matt, um, have you seen Stefan?
Matt: Nope. If you want to kill some time, um, you can rack. Come on. We haven't played in forever. I'll let you break.
Salvatore Boarding House


Zach: I'm full of vervain. I've been putting it in my coffee for 16 years. My blood will only make you worse. Damon?
Damon: So it was your vervain. Good for you. Good for you. Family only runs so deep.
Zach: We're not family, Damon. Only in the most dysfunctional sense. In fact, I avoided having a living, breathing, loving family because of you.
Damon: I don't guess I could talk you into bringing me a rabbit or something? I'd settle for Stefan's diet at this point.
Zach: You know I can't do that.
Damon: You succeeded, Zach. I'm shutting down. You're like your grandfather. He didn't like it when I came to visit, either.
Zach: But you don't visit, Damon. You appear, unannounced, reminding me that this isn't my house; that you're just permitting me to live here. Hell, that you're permitting me to live.
Damon: Someone had to mow the lawn.
Zach: I came to say good-bye, Damon.


Damon: Unlock it. Unlock the door, Zach.


Stefan: Keep it up, Damon. The more energy you expend, the faster you'll go.
Mystic Grill
Elena: And there's Vicki, all nonchalant in the bathroom like it's no big deal that they're hooking up.
Matt: Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. Your brother and my sister, that's weird.
Elena: Yeah.


Matt: How late is he?
Elena: Hitting the hour mark. Nothing's wrong though. Which means I'm not talking boy problems with you.


Matt: Good. I mean, it's not like we were ever best friends or anything.
Elena: Ok. Here goes-- What do you think of Stefan? Is he a good guy?
Matt: Why? what's he done?
Elena: Not any one thing. He's just so secretive all the time. I think there's something that he doesn't want me to know, which makes me want to know all the more.
Matt: Like what? Like that he's a serial killer and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk?
Elena: No, of course not. But what do we know about him, really?
Matt: He's great at football. A little bit of a loner. And as much as I hate saying it, he might be a nice guy.
Elena: So you think I'm just being paranoid?
Matt: I think you should talk to him.


Stefan: Talk to who? I'm so sorry that I'm late.
Elena: What happened?
Stefan: I got held up.
Elena: Is everything ok?
Stefan: There was this thing with my uncle.
Elena: And you couldn't call and tell me that you were going to be an hour late?
Matt: Ok. You two have fun.
Stefan: I'm really sorry. It was unavoidable.
Elena: What was unavoidable? Ok.


Stefan: Oh, uh, Elena, please...
Elena: No, Stefan, don't you get it? Every question gets a vague non-answer. What is so awful that you're afraid to tell me?


Old Man: I know you. My God.
Stefan: I'm sorry?
Old Man: I know you. How can it be?
Stefan: I think you have the wrong person, sir.
Old Man: You haven't aged a day.
Stefan: I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hey, can we...can I take you home and we can talk about it? Is that ok?


Elena: Wait, what was that?
Stefan: I--I don't know. uh, nothing.
Elena: Right, nothing. Ok, um...I gotta go, Stefan. Excuse me.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: I tried. I want so much to make things right, but every instinct in my body is telling me to be careful. What you don't know can hurt you.
Mystic Grill
Logan: Evening, Sheriff. Anything?
Sheriff Forbes: We went over the entire west side of the lake. All the caverns by the falls were clean, no signs of habitat.
Logan: Then they're staying in town.
Sheriff Forbes: We canvassed all abandoned buildings and warehouses.
Logan: There has to be a private residence.
Sheriff Forbes: And that much harder to locate, if not impossible. These creatures are smart. they know how to go undetected.
Logan: Well, someone who only comes out at night should eventually become obvious.
Sheriff Forbes: What about the watch?
Logan: I'm working on it.
Sheriff Forbes: I knew the Gilberts. That watch is passed down to the men in the family. I'd start with Jeremy.
Jenna: Hey, Logan.
Logan: I can't believe you really came.
Jenna: You have an hour. Make it count.
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: You ok?
Elena: Is Vicki in there?
Jeremy: Don't answer a question with another question. Maybe. What's wrong with you?
Elena: I'm miserable.
Jeremy: Well, you should go get something to eat.


Elena: Jenna? Jenna? Stefan? What are you doing here?
Stefan: Dinner. Jeremy told me that Chicken Parmesan is one of your favorites, and I happen to be a good cook. The Italian roots demand it. I can even make my own homemade mozzarella. Only tonight, it is unfortunately store bought. Sorry.
Elena: I don't know what you're trying to accomplish.
Stefan: You want to know me, right? Well, I figure if you're going to dump me, you should at least, um, know who you're dumping. So let's start with Katherine.
Elena: Stefan...
Stefan: She was...the most beautiful girl that I had ever met. She had this perfect olive skin. And she had this laugh. It was ridiculous. I mean, her laugh made you laugh. And she was fun. She knew how to have a good time. But Katherine was also very impatient and entitled and selfish, and, um, impulsive. Enter Damon. He claims that he was with her first. I don't know. I do know that I did some things that...I'm not proud of. And my biggest regret...is not being able to make it right before she died. I miss her, but...I'm no longer crippled by her loss.
Vicki: It was very nice what you did for Stefan. Very romantic.
Jeremy: Well, I was feeling romantic.
Vicki: Look what I found. Elena Gilbert, take one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as needed for pain.
Jeremy: Those are left over from the car accident.
Vicki: So she won't miss them.


Jeremy: No not with that, that's an antique. I feel like we're always getting high.
Vicki: That's the beauty of choice.
Jeremy: Well, then let's choose not to. I mean, we don't have to be high all the time, right?
Vicki: I really hope you're not one of those guys who, now that we're together, tries to change everything about me.
Jeremy: No.
Vicki: Good.
Stefan: I'm an avid reader, a huge Fitzgerald fan, The Great Gatsby, his masterpiece. But I'm no snob. I love some good Grisham. I think Seinfeld is the best American television show for the past 50 years, but I Love Lucy is all-time. The loving cup episode was the best, I think. Huge Scorsese fan. I can watch Taxi Driver over and over again.
Elena: Here, let me.


Stefan: As far as music, it's pretty much across the board. Um, Dylan, Hendrix, Patsy, Willie. A little Kanye. You know what? I even like that one Miley song.


Stefan: Easy.
Elena: I didn't say anything. Hey, this is for the garlic bread, right? Because I'm not eating garlic unless you agree to, too.
Stefan: Are you kidding? I love garlic.


Elena: Ow! Ahh.
Stefan: You ok? um...
Elena: Yeah. Think so.


Elena: Your face...
Stefan: I--I, uh, I think I got something in my eye.
Elena: Stefan. Hey. Stefan! Um, I think that my paranoia has turned into full-blown hallucinations.
Stefan: Part of your charm.


Forbes Residence


Damon: Caroline. Caroline.
Caroline: No, Tiki, do not do the one-piece, ok? I've seen it on you. Trust me. Yeah, but you're going for stripper pole vibe this year.
Damon: Caroline.
Caroline: Yeah, maybe we should wash the cars in slow motion. No.
Damon: Caroline.
Caroline: What? oh, um, no, sorry. Um, so I'll just see you tomorrow. Two-piece. Ok, bye.


Caroline: Shoo, shoo! Shoo! God!
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself, aren't you?
Stefan: Not particularly.
Damon: You won. You got the bad guy. Now nothing could come between you and Elena. Except the truth. The lies will catch up to you, Stefan. As long as you keep lying to yourself about what you are.
Stefan: The beauty of you in there and me out here...is that I can walk away.
Sexy Suds Car Wash
Caroline: No friend discounts. No freebies. No pay ya laters. We are not running a charity here. No, we are not.
Elena: No we are not.


Stefan: Hi.
Elena: Hey!
Caroline: The event is called sexy suds, you know.
Stefan: Did we just get scolded?
Elena: And judged, yeah.
Stefan: Wow.
Elena: I'm sorry, but I guess you're going to have to take that off.
Stefan: I think you have to go first.
Elena: Ok.


Elena: Ok, um--sorry, So not sexy. Ugh.
Stefan: I disagree.


Bonnie: uh-uh, no. None of that tortured pining stuff.
Matt: I'm just observing.
Bonnie: Mm-hmm. Oh. Tiki. this one's yours.
Tiki: Why do I always get the homely ones? Just to be clear, your car's a P.O.S. I mean, we can wash it, but it's still a P.O.S.
Bonnie: You don't have to be rude.
Tiki: Rude is uglying up the road with that junk.


Tiki: Whoa! What the hell?
Matt: Wet and wild, Tik.
Logan: All proceeds are going to the school's athletic department still healing from the tragic death of their football coach William Tanner. The citizens of Mystic Falls coming together in support of one of their own. Cut it.
Jenna: Classy.
Logan: Thank you.
Jenna: But you're still going to video the girls in bikinis, right?
Logan: Well, 53 percent of Americans watch the news with the sound off.
Jenna: Thank you for dinner. I had a nice time.
Logan: Do you remember the last time we were in the school parking lot?
Jenna: Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.
Logan: Really?
Jenna: Nada. Especially not having sex in the minivan.
Logan: That was a good day. What?
Elena: You're getting soap in that.
Stefan: Oh, it's fine.
Elena: I noticed that Damon has one, too. Is there a story behind it?
Stefan: Yeah, it's the family crest from the Italian renaissance.
Elena: Hmm. What's the stone?
Stefan: It's called lapis lazuli.
Elena: Oh. You should really take it off. I could put it in my bag.
Stefan: No, it's...it's fine, really. Thanks, though.
Elena: Ok. I'm gonna get some towels.
Stefan: Ok.
Elena: Hey, we're out of towels and those shimmy things.
Caroline: I'll go get some more. Mind the money.


Damon: Caroline. Caroline, help me. Caroline. Help me. Help me.
Elena: That'll be $20. I saw you last night. You were talking to a friend of mine. At the grill?
Old Man: Well, I...I thought it was somebody I knew.
Elena: Stefan Salvatore.
Old Man: Nah, it can't be. It's just my mind playing tricks on me.
Elena: Where do you think you'd seen him before?
Old Man: When I first moved here, I stayed at the Salvatore boarding house.
Elena: Oh.
Old Man: Stefan was just passing through to visit his uncle. I mean, none of us knew he was even here until the attack.
Elena: The attack?
Old Man: His uncle got killed. Mauled by an animal in the woods.
Elena: His uncle? Zach?
Old Man: Mm-mmm. Joseph.
Elena: I'm sorry, sir. I don't think I'm familiar with the story.
Old Man: Oh, how could you? I mean, this happened years ago.
Tiki: Grandpa, you gotta go. Mom wants you home. Ok?
Old Man: Ah.
Tiki: He wasn't bugging you, was he? He's a little alzy-heimer.
Elena: No, he was sweet. Hey, sir, I'm sorry. Um, are you sure that the man that you saw, that you knew, his name was Stefan Salvatore?
Old Man: Yes. I remember his ring and his brother--
Elena: Damon?
Old Man: Yeah. Stefan and Damon Salvatore.
Elena: When was this?
Old Man: It was early June, 1953. Yeah. June, 1953.
Stefan: Caroline finally freed you, huh?
Elena: Uh, I don't know where she went. She abandoned me. Hey, I realized earlier, I had no idea that your family was from Italy.
Stefan: No? Last name Salvatore didn't do it for you?
Elena: Right. Duh. Are there any other Salvatores in Mystic Falls?
Stefan: My uncle Zach.
Elena: Where did everyone else go?
Stefan: Kinda just spread out.

Elena: Your car was done an hour ago.
Jenna: You're saying that out loud why?
Logan: Hi. Elena, right? I think I met you once when you were 9.
Elena: Oh.
Jenna: Your emotional maturity level when we were together.
Logan: Ouch. Here i thought we were making progress.
Elena: Is he enough in your good graces that i can ask him for a favor?
Logan: If i do her a favor, will i get back in your good graces?
Jenna: Uh, a very reluctant maybe to both.
Logan: Done. Wait. One condition. Dinner, tonight, your house.
Jenna: Fine. But you're eating leftovers.
Logan: Ooh. What do you need?
Elena: Do you have access to old news stories, say, fifties?
Logan: Yeah, at the station. Between the archives and the Internet, we pretty much have everything.
Elena: I have this report way past due. It'd be a life saver.
Logan: Heading there now. Let's go.
Elena: If anyone asks, you don't know where I went. I don't want Caroline to know that I left.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Caroline, help me. Caroline. Help me.
Caroline: Damon? Damon? Damon? Oh, my god! What is this? How did I know that you were here?
Damon: Because I wanted you to. Very, very badly. Let me out of here. Please.
Caroline: You bit me.
Damon: You liked it. Remember?
Caroline: Why do I keep remembering the same things, but in different ways?
Damon: You remember what I want you to remember. And now that the vervain has passed out of your system, you won't remember what you're about to do.
Caroline: What am I about to do?
Damon: You're gonna open the door. You're gonna open the door.
Zach: No! No! Get out of here. Run! Run!

Tiki: Sweeper duty.
Bonnie: What?
Tiki: We have to clean the pavement.
Bonnie: It's a car wash. By definition, the pavement's clean.
Tiki: But not dry.
Bonnie: And I'm doing this why?
Tiki: Caroline bailed, so that leaves me in charge. Fabulous.


Stefan: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Hey.
Bonnie: What just happened?
Stefan: You were in some kind of a trance.
Bonnie: Did I do this?
Stefan: I think so, yeah.
Bonnie: Nobody else saw, did they? Don't tell anybody. Please.
TV Station
Logan: We digitized all our archives last year. You can pull all the remote footage right up on screen. What is it exactly you're looking for?
Elena: An incident from 1953. If it even happened--at the old Salvatore boarding house.


Logan: Sorry, one second. Yeah? Fire? All right, be right there. I gotta go. You believe there's actual news to cover in this town? All right, use keywords to search the database. It's pretty easy to navigate. And Brady down in tech will help you out with anything you need.
Elena: Ok.
Logan: All right? Oh, hey. Could you put in a good word for me with Jenna?
Elena: You got it.
Logan: All right. Good luck.

Vicki: What?
Jeremy: I'm stoned in a cemetery.
Vicki: They don't mind, they're dead. Let me take this up a notch. Hey, Tony.
Tony: Oh! Nice. Vickies from Vicki. Ha!
Girl: Well, thank you, Elena Gilbert, whoever you are.
Jeremy: You took those from the house?
Vicki: She wasn't using it.
Jeremy: She's gonna notice if they're gone. That's not cool.
Vicki: It's no big deal, Jer.
Jeremy: Yeah, it kinda is, Vick.
Boy: Damn, dude.
Tony: Vicki brought the party police.
Vicki: Shut up, Tony. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad.
Jeremy: Well, what are we doing, partying in a cemetery with a bunch of losers?
Vicki: Those are my friends.
Jeremy: They're waste of space small-town lifers.
Vicki: Yeah? What am I?
Jeremy: You're different, Vick.
Vicki: No, you are. You're the kid with the big house who's acting out because his parents died. Guess what-- You'll get over it. You will pull yourself together, move on, and one day tell your kids stories about your dark period growing up. And I'll still be here, waiting tables at the grill, partying at the cemetery with a bunch of waste of space small-town lifers.
Jeremy: Look--
Vicki: Go home, Jeremy. If I want to feel like crap about myself, I'll just go back to Tyler.

Matt: No, not for a while.
Stefan: You think she went home?
Matt: Not sure.
Stefan: Thanks.
Matt: Hey. I'm not saying this for you. I'm saying it for her. But she's big on trust. So whatever you're holding back from her, the more you try to hide it, the more she won't stop till she figures it out.

Sheriff Forbes: I didn't see you at the car wash.

Jenna: Logan? Logan?
Elena: People are supposed to be who they say they are. And not lie or hide their true selves.
Jeremy: What are you doing here?
Logan: Oh, hey, man. Just looking for the bathroom.
Elena: It's not possible. I'm not a believer, I can't be. But how can I deny what's right in front of me? Someone who never grows old...


Old Man: 1953.
Elena: Never gets hurt...


Elena: Oh, my god, your hand! Is it deep? How bad is it?
Elena: Someone who changes in ways that can't be explained...


Elena: Hey, um, are you ok? Your eye. Your face.
Elena: Girls bitten...


Elena: What is that? Oh, my god, what happened to you?
Caroline: It's nothing!
Elena: Bodies drained of blood...


Elena: Did she say what kind of animal it was?
Matt: She said it was a vampire.

Stefan: You must be Miss Pierce.
Katherine: Please, call me Katherine.

Salvatore Boarding House
Elena: What are you? What are you?
Stefan: You know.
Elena: No, I don't.
Stefan: Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be here.
Elena: It's not possible. It can't be.
Stefan: Everything you know...And every belief that you have is about to change. Are you ready for that?
Elena: What are you?
Stefan: I'm a vampire.
Elena: I shouldn't have come.
Stefan: No. Please.


Elena: No. No. How did you do that?
Stefan: Please don't be afraid of me.
Elena: Let me go.
Stefan: No. Elena, there's things that you have to know and understand.
Elena: Let me go!
Stefan: Elena, please.


Gilbert Residence


Stefan: Elena. I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Elena: All those animal attacks, those people who died...
Stefan: No. That was Damon!
Elena: Damon?
Stefan: Yes. I don't drink human blood. That's not how I choose to survive, but Damon does! I'll explain everything to you, but I beg you, Elena, do not tell anybody.
Elena: How can you ask me that?
Stefan: Because you knowing this is dangerous for so many reasons. You can hate me, but I need you to trust me.
Elena: Just go. Just go, please. Go. If you mean me no harm, then you'll go!
Stefan: I never wanted this.


Cemetery


Stefan: Hello?
Damon: I want my ring.
Stefan: Where are you?
Damon: I'm at the sizzler. I had the buffet. Where's my ring?
Stefan: I don't have it. Where are you? What have you done?
Damon: No, what have you done? You're the one that locked me in the basement and starved me, so whatever I've done, whoever I've sucked dry is on you, buddy.
Stefan: You're being careless. How many more animal attacks is this town gonna believe, huh?
Damon: I know how to cover my tracks, Stefan. Where's my ring?
Stefan: I gave it to Zach to hide. Probably shouldn't have killed him.
Damon: ...Ah, you almost got me. Where is it?
Stefan: I'll get it back, but I need time.
Damon: What, did you FedEx it to Rome?! Where is it? I want my ring, Stefan, or my next stop's Elena's.
Stefan: I already want you dead. Don't give me another reason to make it happen.
Damon: Don't give me another reason to rip you apart.
Stefan: Yeah? Is that gonna be before or after you get your ring back?
Damon: Just get it.


Damon: You just don't wanna die, do you?


Mystic Grill
Elena: You said you would explain everything. That's why I asked you to meet me here. When you Google vampire you get a world of fiction. What's the reality?
Stefan: I can tell you whatever you wanna know.
Elena: I know you eat garlic.
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: And somehow, sunlight's not an issue.


Waitress: Hi, here are your drinks.
Elena: Thank you.


Stefan: We have rings that protect us.
Elena: Crucifixes?
Stefan: Decorative.
Elena: Holy water?
Stefan: Drinkable.
Elena: Mirrors?
Stefan: Myth.
Elena: You said you don't kill to survive.
Stefan: Animal blood keeps me alive, but not as strong as Damon. He can be very powerful.
Elena: And yet you let him get involved with Caroline?
Stefan: Forcing Damon not to do something is much more dangerous, believe me.
Elena: He was hurting her!
Stefan: He was feeding on her. He was able to take away her memories of being bitten using a form of mind compulsion. She never knew what was happening to her. If he wanted to kill her, he would have.
Elena: Is that supposed to make it ok?
Stefan: No. No, none of this is ok, Elena. I know that.
Elena: Are there any others, aside from you and Damon?
Stefan: Not in Mystic Falls; not anymore.
Elena: Not anymore?
Stefan: There was a time when this town was...very much aware of vampires, and it didn't end well for anybody. That's why it's important that you don't tell anyone.
Elena: I can't promise that.
Stefan: Elena...Give me today. I will answer any questions that you have, and when it's over, you can decide for yourself what you wanna do with what you know. It'll be your choice.
Cemetery


Logan: Never smelled one this bad before.
Sheriff Forbes: It tried to cover its tracks.
Logan: Are you sure?
Sheriff Forbes: I'm positive. You only burn a corpse to try to hide cause of death, and there are no shell casings.
Logan: We know who they are?
Sheriff Forbes: Doc'll have to check their dental records.
Logan: What story should i run?
Sheriff Forbes: Drug deal gone bad. It's not too big a stretch.
Logan: I got the Gilbert watch.
Sheriff Forbes: Good.


Policeman: Found this in the brush about 10 yards away.


Sheriff Forbes: Vicki Donovan.
Logan: You know her?
Sheriff Forbes: I went to high school with her mother.

Damon: Where are you, Stefan? I'm trapped at the house, and I'm getting really bored and really impatient, and I don't do bored and impatient. Bring me my ring. Damn it.


Damon: Aw, don't get blood on the couch!


Damon: Please? I got you good, didn't I?


Damon: Well, you're not gonna be any fun today. I'm so gonna regret this.


Damon: Drink up. Drink it up. Don't drip. There you go. Good girl. That's it.

Stefan: This...Didn't used to be nowhere. Used to be my home.
Elena: It looks so...
Stefan: Old? It's because they are.
Elena: Wait. How long have you...
Stefan: I've been 17 years old since 1864.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: You said you wanted to know. I'm not gonna hold anything back. Half a century before the boarding house was even built, this was my family's home. Damon and I...We were both born here. The Salvatore brothers, best friends.
Salvatore Estate 1864


Stefan: Wait. Where did you learn this game?
Damon: Camp outside Atlanta. One of the officers picked it up at Harvard. Catch.


Stefan: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are the rules? What are the rules?


Katherine: Who needs rules? Mind if I join you?
Stefan: Uh, well, you could, uh...you could get hurt. My brother likes to play rough.
Katherine: Somehow, I think that you play rougher.


Damon: Why are you just standing there? That is a girl who clearly wants to be chased. If you don't do it, I will.


Salvatore Estate Ruins
Elena: You knew Katherine in 1864? Damon made it seem like...
Stefan: Damon was trying to make you think that...I was still heartbroken. He saw that I was happy with you, and he wanted to ruin it.
Elena: All because you loved the same women 145 years ago?
Stefan: She wasn't just any girl.

Katherine: Ha! I win. What's my prize?
Damon: What would you like it to be?
Stefan:  They extended your leave?
Damon: I was simply having too much fun to return to battle.
Stefan: Your commitment to the confederacy is inspiring.


Katherine: Well, this works out wonderfully for me.
Damon: How's that, miss Katherine?
Katherine: Now I'll have both of you here to keep me entertained. First and foremost, I'll need someone to escort me to the founder's ball.
Damon and Stefan: With pleasure. I would be honored.
Katherine: The smart and kind Salvatore brothers both coming to my rescue. How will I ever choose?


Salvatore Estate Ruins


Stefan: She chose me. I escorted her to the ball at the original Lockwood mansion.
Elena: The first founder's party...Where you signed the registry.
Stefan: I didn't care that I had gotten something that my brother wanted. I didn't even care if it hurt him. I only knew that I wanted her.
Elena: So he was upset.
Stefan: That's the thing about Damon. He doesn't get mad. He just gets even.
Salvatore Boarding House


Vicki: Oh, man. That shower was so great. What did you give me?
Damon: Some blood. You loved it.
Vicki: I did? Wait. I'm confused. How did we get here?
Damon: We met in the woods. You were drunk. I attacked you. Then I killed all of your friends and brought you here, gave you same blood. You loved it. And now we're gonna party till the sun goes down.
Vicki: Ok. Um, but first, can I have another hit? That blood was so good.
Damon: Only if I can.


Salvatore Estate Ruins
Stefan: What Damon wants, Damon usually gets. I didn't know it at the time, but...Turns out that night...Katherine was with him, too.
Elena: So he stole her from you, not the other way around?
Stefan: Turns out she wasn't ours to steal.
Salvatore Estate 1864


Stefan: I will love you forever.
Katherine: Forever is a very long time, you know.
Stefan: Not long enough.


Katherine: Good morning. Clear the room, please.


Katherine: You're upset.
Stefan: Your face, it was like a demon.
Katherine: But you're not afraid.
Stefan: Get away from me. Get away.
Katherine:  It doesn't change the way you feel about me. You will not tell anyone.
Stefan: I...
Katherine: Shh. We will go on exactly as we have.
Stefan: Yes. We will go on.
Katherine: You have no idea of the future I have planned for us, Stefan...You, me, and Damon. No rules.
Salvatore Estate Ruins
Stefan: She could control my mind; and Damon's. She compelled each of us to keep the secret from the other. She wanted all of us to be together. Forever. Didn't work out that way, but...Damon and I, looks like we're stuck with each other...Like it or not.


Elena: Is that Damon's ring?
Stefan: I took it from him, but I have to give it back.
Elena: No, don't, Stefan. Keep it hidden.
Stefan: Elena, if I don't give it to him, he'll retaliate in the only way that he knows he can hurt me.
Elena: And how is that?
Stefan: By hurting you.
Lockwood House
Sheriff Forbes: We're working on it, Mayor Lockwood.
Mr Lockwood: Doc ID the bodies?
Sheriff Forbes: A few townies. Notorious druggies.
Mr Lockwood: I suppose that'll make it easy for people to buy the story. And Vicki Donovan?
Sheriff Forbes: She's not one of the deceased.
Mr Lockwood: Where the hell is she?
Sheriff Forbes: I wish I knew.
Logan: Sorry I'm late.
Mr Lockwood: You have the watch? It's ready.
Logan: That's it?
Mr Lockwood: Yes. That's it.


Salvatore Boarding House


Vicki: I am so over Tyler, so over him. I knew from the beginning that I was only a piece of ass to him, but i thought maybe if he got to know me better, he might see something more. But no. Now, Jeremy, on the other hand, that's all he's ever seen in me is something more, and i like that.
Damon: Jeremy, huh? Elena's brother?
Vicki: Yeah, yeah. So, Elena used to date my brother, and they were always together, so Jeremy would always be hanging around and crushing on me and...Hey, why don't you have a girlfriend? You're, like, totally cool and so hot.
Damon: I know.
Vicki: Don't you wanna be in love?
Damon: I've been in love. It's painful and pointless and overrated.
Vicki: Except when it isn't.
Damon: No more talking. Let's dance.
Vicki: My mom spends most of her time in Virginia beach with Pete. He drives trucks. I don't remember my dad, but from what I gather, he's not worth remembering.
Damon: Your life is so pathetic.
Vicki: Yeah. I mean, I'm the screwed-up one. Matt's got it so easy. He's the golden boy. I mean, he's gonna get a football scholarship and marry Elena and have a lawn mower and some babies, and when i think of my future, I just come up blank.
Damon: You are so damaged.
Vicki: Yep.
Damon: I mean, you don't have one hint of self-esteem.
Vicki: Nope, none.
Damon: I think I know what can help you.
Vicki: So what's that?
Damon: Death.


Vicki: What happened? We were dancing, and then...
Damon: Then I killed you.
Vicki: What?
Damon: You're dead.
Vicki: I'm dead?
Damon: Yeah, well, let's not make a big deal out of it. You drank my blood, I killed you, and now you have to feed in order to complete the process.
Vicki: You're wasted.
Damon: You don't wanna be out there all alone. You're about to get really freaky.
Vicki: Ok, I had a really good time. I just wanna go home.
Damon: You're gonna start craving blood, and until you get it, you're gonna feel very out of it. You have to be careful.
Vicki: Come on, move.
Damon: See? you're already starting to fall apart.
Vicki: And I'm going home now.
Damon: Ok, fine. I'm just warning you. Actually, you know what? You should go. In fact, if I were you, I would stop by your boyfriend Jeremy's house.
Vicki: Yeah, whatever.
Damon: Bye. Tell Elena I said hi and if you see Stefan, tell him to call me.
Woods
Sheriff Forbes: I got Stanley on the Moore street entrance. The rest of us will cover other access points. Call him or call me if that thing goes off. Don't use the radio. Cellphones only.
Logan: Got it.
Sheriff Forbes: You've got 8 rounds. Remember, wood bullets won't kill him, but it'll wound him enough for you to get close and stake him. You sure you can handle this?
Logan: Of course I can.
Sheriff Forbes: You ever staked a vampire before?
Logan: Have you?
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: I'm Coming!
Vicki: Hey. The sun is killing me. My eyes are on fire.
Jeremy: Where have you been?
Vicki: It's good. Everything's good.


Jeremy: Did something happen?
Vicki: I'm hungry. What do you got to eat?
Jeremy: You're high? Vicki, it's the middle of the day.
Vicki: Could you just not talk so loud? My head, it hurts. I need quiet.
Salvatore Estate Ruins
Elena: The mind control...You said Katherine used. Do you ever do that to me?
Stefan: No. That necklace, it contains an herb called vervain. It protects you from being compelled. I wanted to protect you from Damon's influence. But I also wanted to...Protect you from me. Elena, you should never take that necklace off...Because no matter what happens after today, no matter how you feel about me...You'll know that you were free to make your own choice.
Gilbert Residence
Matt: Where is she?
Jeremy: Come this way.
Matt: What's she on?
Jeremy: I...I don't know.
Matt: Hey, Vic. How you doin'?
Vicki: Not good, Mattie. I hurt.
Matt: Ok, where's it hurt?
Vicki: My gums. My jaw hurts. My gum...there's something in my gums, and it hurts.
Matt: Ok, well...
Vicki: No. Just leave me alone.
Matt: Come on, Vic. Don't be like that. Let's get you home.
Vicki: Just turn it off!
Jeremy: Turn what off?
Vicki: The talking, the chatter, just turn it off.


Man on TV: ...horribly. Three bodies were found dead in what is believed to be a drug deal gone awry. The bodies have yet to be identified. They were discovered earlier today over at the old Mystic Falls cemetery.
Jeremy: That's where we were last night.
Matt: What happened, Vic?
Man on TV: ...homicide, and are fast under way looking for suspects. They're asking anyone with information...
Matt: I'm calling the cops.
Vicki: No. Don't.
Jeremy: What happened after I left last night, Vick?


Matt: Jer, are you ok ?
Jeremy: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Matt: Damn, Vick.


Elena: What's going on?
Matt: She's really messed up.
Stefan: Elena, back up. Vicki, look at me. Focus. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Guys, take her up to bed. Shut the blinds. She's gonna be ok. Come on. Come on.


Elena: You know what's wrong with her?
Stefan: Yeah.
Elena: What is it?
Stefan: She's transitioning.
Elena: Transitioning to what?
Stefan: A vampire.
Elena: What?
Stefan: Damon must have gotten to her. She's new. She hasn't completed her transformation yet.
Elena: H-how does she do that?
Stefan: She has to feed on human blood.
Elena: And what if she doesn't?
Stefan: She'll die. She may only have a few hours.
Elena: She's upstairs with him right now.
Stefan: It's ok. She doesn't know what's happening to her yet.
Elena: So when is she gonna know?
Stefan: Right now, she doesn't remember anything. A part of her is still human, but slowly, the deeper she gets into the transition, the memories will start to come back, and then she'll know she has to make the choice.
Elena: The same choice you made?


Vicki: I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.
Jeremy: Aw, you just...you need to sleep it off, ok?


Vicki: No.
Matt: Vick. Vicki!
Jeremy: She was fine, and then she just...she just freaked out.
Matt: I'm gonna go look for her. Call me if you hear anything.
Stefan: I can track her.
Elena: Go.

Sheriff Forbes: Yeah.
Logan: I think I got something. It's pointing towards the old cemetery.
Sheriff Forbes: Headed your way.

Jeremy: Maybe we should check in with Matt.
Elena: He'll call when he finds her.
Jeremy: Well, what are we supposed to do?
Elena: We wait. We're supposed to wait.
Jeremy: I don't know what's wrong with her.
Elena: She'll be fine. It'll all be fine.


Elena: Jeremy, go upstairs.
Damon: You're afraid of me. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess. Stefan finally 'fessed up.
Elena: Stay away from me.
Damon: Hey, there's no need to be rude. I'm just looking for Stefan. May I come in? Oh, wait. Of course I can. I've been invited. We can cut to the chase if you want. I'm not gonna kill you right now. That wouldn't serve my greater agenda. So...Where's Stefan?
Elena: He's out looking for Vicki.
Damon: Don't look at me with those judgey little eyes. Girl's gonna thank me for what I did to her.
Elena: Did you thank Katherine?
Damon: Mmm. Got the whole life story, huh?
Elena: I got enough.
Damon: Oh, I doubt that. Tell my brother I'm looking for him. Oh, tip for later, be careful who you invite in the house.
Cemetery
Stefan: Vicki.
Vicki: I'm starting to remember things, what he is, what he said. I remember you. The hospital, the...the rooftop, it's all coming back.
Stefan: I'm so sorry. Damon had no right to do this to you.
Vicki: He said that I need to feed. What will happen if i don't?
Stefan: You'll fade quickly...And then it'll all just be over.
Vicki: I'll be dead.
Stefan: Hey.
Vicki: I don't want this.
Stefan: I know. It'll be ok. You're gonna be ok. I can help you.
Vicki: Is it better? Is it better? Will I be better? I wanna go home. Will you take me home?
Stefan: Ok.


Stefan: Ahh!
Vicki: No!


Damon: It's wood. They know. If anyone's gonna kill you, it's gonna be me. My ring.


Stefan: No! No! Vicki!
Vicki: I'm sorry.
Damon: Oops.

Elena: You're bleeding.
Stefan: No, it's ok. It's ok. I'm ok.
Stefan: I couldn't stop her. I tried.
Elena: What does that mean?
Stefan: She fed, and then I lost her.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: I'll take care of it. I'll find her, and I will show her that she can live like I do. I will make sure that she does not hurt anybody, Elena. I promise you.
Elena: What do I tell my brother and...and Matt?
Stefan: We'll come up with a story.
Elena: You mean we'll come up with a lie.
Stefan: I'm so sorry.
Elena: I gave you today just like you asked. And I understand that you would never do anything to hurt me, and I promise I will keep your secret, but...I can't be with you, Stefan. I'm sorry. I...I just can't...

Elena: What are you? What are you?
Stefan: You know.
Elena: No, I don't.

Stefan: Everything you know...And every belief that you have is about to change. Are you ready for that?
Elena: What are you?
Stefan: I'm a vampire.
Elena: I shouldn't have come.
Stefan: No. Please.


Elena: No. No. How did you do that?
Stefan: Please don't be afraid of me.

Stefan: Elena. I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Elena: All those animal attacks, those people who died...
Stefan: No. That was Damon!
Elena: Damon?
Stefan: Yes. I don't drink human blood. That's not how I choose to survive, but Damon does! I'll explain everything to you, but I beg you, Elena, do not tell anybody.
Elena: How can you ask me that?
Stefan: Because you knowing this is dangerous for so many reasons. You can hate me, but I need you to trust me.
Elena: Just go. Just go, please. Go. If you mean me no harm, then you'll go!
Stefan: I never wanted this.

Damon: No, what have you done? You're the one that locked me in the basement and starved me, so whatever I've done, whoever I've sucked dry is on you, buddy.
Stefan: You're being careless. How many more animal attacks is this town gonna believe, huh?
Damon: I know how to cover my tracks, Stefan. Where's my ring?
Stefan: I gave it to Zach to hide. Probably shouldn't have killed him.
Damon: ...Ah, you almost got me. Where is it?
Stefan: I'll get it back, but I need time.
Damon: What, did you FedEx it to Rome?! Where is it? I want my ring, Stefan, or my next stop's Elena's.
Stefan: I already want you dead. Don't give me another reason to make it happen.
Damon: Don't give me another reason to rip you apart.
Stefan: Yeah? Is that gonna be before or after you get your ring back?
Damon: Just get it.


Damon: You just don't wanna die, do you?


Mystic Grill
Elena: You said you would explain everything. That's why I asked you to meet me here. When you Google vampire you get a world of fiction. What's the reality?
Stefan: I can tell you whatever you wanna know.
Elena: I know you eat garlic.
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: And somehow, sunlight's not an issue.


Waitress: Hi, here are your drinks.
Elena: Thank you.


Stefan: We have rings that protect us.
Elena: Crucifixes?
Stefan: Decorative.
Elena: Holy water?
Stefan: Drinkable.
Elena: Mirrors?
Stefan: Myth.
Elena: You said you don't kill to survive.
Stefan: Animal blood keeps me alive, but not as strong as Damon. He can be very powerful.
Elena: And yet you let him get involved with Caroline?
Stefan: Forcing Damon not to do something is much more dangerous, believe me.
Elena: He was hurting her!
Stefan: He was feeding on her. He was able to take away her memories of being bitten using a form of mind compulsion. She never knew what was happening to her. If he wanted to kill her, he would have.
Elena: Is that supposed to make it ok?
Stefan: No. No, none of this is ok, Elena. I know that.
Elena: Are there any others, aside from you and Damon?
Stefan: Not in Mystic Falls; not anymore.
Elena: Not anymore?
Stefan: There was a time when this town was...very much aware of vampires, and it didn't end well for anybody. That's why it's important that you don't tell anyone.
Elena: I can't promise that.
Stefan: Elena...Give me today. I will answer any questions that you have, and when it's over, you can decide for yourself what you wanna do with what you know. It'll be your choice.
Cemetery


Logan: Never smelled one this bad before.
Sheriff Forbes: It tried to cover its tracks.
Logan: Are you sure?
Sheriff Forbes: I'm positive. You only burn a corpse to try to hide cause of death, and there are no shell casings.
Logan: We know who they are?
Sheriff Forbes: Doc'll have to check their dental records.
Logan: What story should i run?
Sheriff Forbes: Drug deal gone bad. It's not too big a stretch.
Logan: I got the Gilbert watch.
Sheriff Forbes: Good.


Policeman: Found this in the brush about 10 yards away.


Sheriff Forbes: Vicki Donovan.
Logan: You know her?
Sheriff Forbes: I went to high school with her mother.
Logan: Think she's one of these?
Sheriff Forbes: I hope not.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Where are you, Stefan? I'm trapped at the house, and I'm getting really bored and really impatient, and I don't do bored and impatient. Bring me my ring. Damn it.


Damon: Aw, don't get blood on the couch!


Damon: Please? I got you good, didn't I?


Damon: Well, you're not gonna be any fun today. I'm so gonna regret this.


Damon: Drink up. Drink it up. Don't drip. There you go. Good girl. That's it.
Woods


Stefan: Stop here.
Elena: What are we doing here?


Stefan: I want to show you something.
Elena: In the middle of nowhere?
Stefan: This...Didn't used to be nowhere. Used to be my home.
Elena: It looks so...
Stefan: Old? It's because they are.
Elena: Wait. How long have you...
Stefan: I've been 17 years old since 1864.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: You said you wanted to know. I'm not gonna hold anything back. Half a century before the boarding house was even built, this was my family's home. Damon and I...We were both born here. The Salvatore brothers, best friends.
Salvatore Estate 1864


Stefan: Wait. Where did you learn this game?
Damon: Camp outside Atlanta. One of the officers picked it up at Harvard. Catch.


Stefan: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are the rules? What are the rules?


Katherine: Who needs rules? Mind if I join you?
Stefan: Uh, well, you could, uh...you could get hurt. My brother likes to play rough.
Katherine: Somehow, I think that you play rougher.


Damon: Why are you just standing there? That is a girl who clearly wants to be chased. If you don't do it, I will.


Salvatore Estate Ruins
Elena: You knew Katherine in 1864? Damon made it seem like...
Stefan: Damon was trying to make you think that...I was still heartbroken. He saw that I was happy with you, and he wanted to ruin it.
Elena: All because you loved the same women 145 years ago?
Stefan: She wasn't just any girl.
Salvatore Estate 1864


Katherine: Ha! I win. What's my prize?
Damon: What would you like it to be?
Stefan:  They extended your leave?
Damon: I was simply having too much fun to return to battle.
Stefan: Your commitment to the confederacy is inspiring.


Katherine: Well, this works out wonderfully for me.
Damon: How's that, miss Katherine?
Katherine: Now I'll have both of you here to keep me entertained. First and foremost, I'll need someone to escort me to the founder's ball.
Damon and Stefan: With pleasure. I would be honored.
Katherine: The smart and kind Salvatore brothers both coming to my rescue. How will I ever choose?


Salvatore Estate Ruins


Stefan: She chose me. I escorted her to the ball at the original Lockwood mansion.
Elena: The first founder's party...Where you signed the registry.
Stefan: I didn't care that I had gotten something that my brother wanted. I didn't even care if it hurt him. I only knew that I wanted her.
Elena: So he was upset.
Stefan: That's the thing about Damon. He doesn't get mad. He just gets even.
Salvatore Boarding House


Vicki: Oh, man. That shower was so great. What did you give me?
Damon: Some blood. You loved it.
Vicki: I did? Wait. I'm confused. How did we get here?
Damon: We met in the woods. You were drunk. I attacked you. Then I killed all of your friends and brought you here, gave you same blood. You loved it. And now we're gonna party till the sun goes down.
Vicki: Ok. Um, but first, can I have another hit? That blood was so good.
Damon: Only if I can.


Salvatore Estate Ruins
Stefan: What Damon wants, Damon usually gets. I didn't know it at the time, but...Turns out that night...Katherine was with him, too.
Elena: So he stole her from you, not the other way around?
Stefan: Turns out she wasn't ours to steal.
Salvatore Estate 1864


Stefan: I will love you forever.
Katherine: Forever is a very long time, you know.
Stefan: Not long enough.


Katherine: Good morning. Clear the room, please.


Katherine: You're upset.
Stefan: Your face, it was like a demon.
Katherine: But you're not afraid.
Stefan: Get away from me. Get away.
Katherine:  It doesn't change the way you feel about me. You will not tell anyone.
Stefan: I...
Katherine: Shh. We will go on exactly as we have.
Stefan: Yes. We will go on.
Katherine: You have no idea of the future I have planned for us, Stefan...You, me, and Damon. No rules.
Salvatore Estate Ruins
Stefan: She could control my mind; and Damon's. She compelled each of us to keep the secret from the other. She wanted all of us to be together. Forever. Didn't work out that way, but...Damon and I, looks like we're stuck with each other...Like it or not.


Elena: Is that Damon's ring?
Stefan: I took it from him, but I have to give it back.
Elena: No, don't, Stefan. Keep it hidden.
Stefan: Elena, if I don't give it to him, he'll retaliate in the only way that he knows he can hurt me.
Elena: And how is that?
Stefan: By hurting you.
Lockwood House
Sheriff Forbes: We're working on it, Mayor Lockwood.
Mr Lockwood: Doc ID the bodies?
Sheriff Forbes: A few townies. Notorious druggies.
Mr Lockwood: I suppose that'll make it easy for people to buy the story. And Vicki Donovan?
Sheriff Forbes: She's not one of the deceased.
Mr Lockwood: Where the hell is she?
Sheriff Forbes: I wish I knew.
Logan: Sorry I'm late.
Mr Lockwood: You have the watch? It's ready.
Logan: That's it?
Mr Lockwood: Yes. That's it.


Salvatore Boarding House


Vicki: I am so over Tyler, so over him. I knew from the beginning that I was only a piece of ass to him, but i thought maybe if he got to know me better, he might see something more. But no. Now, Jeremy, on the other hand, that's all he's ever seen in me is something more, and i like that.
Damon: Jeremy, huh? Elena's brother?
Vicki: Yeah, yeah. So, Elena used to date my brother, and they were always together, so Jeremy would always be hanging around and crushing on me and...Hey, why don't you have a girlfriend? You're, like, totally cool and so hot.
Damon: I know.
Vicki: Don't you wanna be in love?
Damon: I've been in love. It's painful and pointless and overrated.
Vicki: Except when it isn't.
Damon: No more talking. Let's dance.
Vicki: My mom spends most of her time in Virginia beach with Pete. He drives trucks. I don't remember my dad, but from what I gather, he's not worth remembering.
Damon: Your life is so pathetic.
Vicki: Yeah. I mean, I'm the screwed-up one. Matt's got it so easy. He's the golden boy. I mean, he's gonna get a football scholarship and marry Elena and have a lawn mower and some babies, and when i think of my future, I just come up blank.
Damon: You are so damaged.
Vicki: Yep.
Damon: I mean, you don't have one hint of self-esteem.
Vicki: Nope, none.
Damon: I think I know what can help you.
Vicki: So what's that?
Damon: Death.


Vicki: What happened? We were dancing, and then...
Damon: Then I killed you.
Vicki: What?
Damon: You're dead.
Vicki: I'm dead?
Damon: Yeah, well, let's not make a big deal out of it. You drank my blood, I killed you, and now you have to feed in order to complete the process.
Vicki: You're wasted.
Damon: You don't wanna be out there all alone. You're about to get really freaky.
Vicki: Ok, I had a really good time. I just wanna go home.
Damon: You're gonna start craving blood, and until you get it, you're gonna feel very out of it. You have to be careful.
Vicki: Come on, move.
Damon: See? you're already starting to fall apart.
Vicki: And I'm going home now.
Damon: Ok, fine. I'm just warning you. Actually, you know what? You should go. In fact, if I were you, I would stop by your boyfriend Jeremy's house.
Vicki: Yeah, whatever.
Damon: Bye. Tell Elena I said hi and if you see Stefan, tell him to call me.
Woods
Sheriff Forbes: I got Stanley on the Moore street entrance. The rest of us will cover other access points. Call him or call me if that thing goes off. Don't use the radio. Cellphones only.
Logan: Got it.
Sheriff Forbes: You've got 8 rounds. Remember, wood bullets won't kill him, but it'll wound him enough for you to get close and stake him. You sure you can handle this?
Logan: Of course I can.
Sheriff Forbes: You ever staked a vampire before?
Logan: Have you?
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: I'm Coming!
Vicki: Hey. The sun is killing me. My eyes are on fire.
Jeremy: Where have you been?
Vicki: It's good. Everything's good.


Jeremy: Did something happen?
Vicki: I'm hungry. What do you got to eat?
Jeremy: You're high? Vicki, it's the middle of the day.
Vicki: Could you just not talk so loud? My head, it hurts. I need quiet.
Salvatore Estate Ruins
Elena: The mind control...You said Katherine used. Do you ever do that to me?
Stefan: No. That necklace, it contains an herb called vervain. It protects you from being compelled. I wanted to protect you from Damon's influence. But I also wanted to...Protect you from me. Elena, you should never take that necklace off...Because no matter what happens after today, no matter how you feel about me...You'll know that you were free to make your own choice.
Gilbert Residence
Matt: Where is she?
Jeremy: Come this way.
Matt: What's she on?
Jeremy: I...I don't know.
Matt: Hey, Vic. How you doin'?
Vicki: Not good, Mattie. I hurt.
Matt: Ok, where's it hurt?
Vicki: My gums. My jaw hurts. My gum...there's something in my gums, and it hurts.
Matt: Ok, well...
Vicki: No. Just leave me alone.
Matt: Come on, Vic. Don't be like that. Let's get you home.
Vicki: Just turn it off!
Jeremy: Turn what off?
Vicki: The talking, the chatter, just turn it off.


Man on TV: ...horribly. Three bodies were found dead in what is believed to be a drug deal gone awry. The bodies have yet to be identified. They were discovered earlier today over at the old Mystic Falls cemetery.
Jeremy: That's where we were last night.
Matt: What happened, Vic?
Man on TV: ...homicide, and are fast under way looking for suspects. They're asking anyone with information...
Matt: I'm calling the cops.
Vicki: No. Don't.
Jeremy: What happened after I left last night, Vick?


Matt: Jer, are you ok ?
Jeremy: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Matt: Damn, Vick.


Elena: What's going on?
Matt: She's really messed up.
Stefan: Elena, back up. Vicki, look at me. Focus. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Guys, take her up to bed. Shut the blinds. She's gonna be ok. Come on. Come on.


Elena: You know what's wrong with her?
Stefan: Yeah.
Elena: What is it?
Stefan: She's transitioning.
Elena: Transitioning to what?
Stefan: A vampire.
Elena: What?
Stefan: Damon must have gotten to her. She's new. She hasn't completed her transformation yet.
Elena: H-how does she do that?
Stefan: She has to feed on human blood.
Elena: And what if she doesn't?
Stefan: She'll die. She may only have a few hours.
Elena: She's upstairs with him right now.
Stefan: It's ok. She doesn't know what's happening to her yet.
Elena: So when is she gonna know?
Stefan: Right now, she doesn't remember anything. A part of her is still human, but slowly, the deeper she gets into the transition, the memories will start to come back, and then she'll know she has to make the choice.
Elena: The same choice you made?


Vicki: I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.
Jeremy: Aw, you just...you need to sleep it off, ok?


Vicki: No.
Matt: Vick. Vicki!
Jeremy: She was fine, and then she just...she just freaked out.
Matt: I'm gonna go look for her. Call me if you hear anything.
Stefan: I can track her.
Elena: Go.
Woods


Sheriff Forbes: Yeah.
Logan: I think I got something. It's pointing towards the old cemetery.
Sheriff Forbes: Headed your way.
Gilbert Residence
Jeremy: Maybe we should check in with Matt.
Elena: He'll call when he finds her.
Jeremy: Well, what are we supposed to do?
Elena: We wait. We're supposed to wait.
Jeremy: I don't know what's wrong with her.
Elena: She'll be fine. It'll all be fine.


Elena: Jeremy, go upstairs.
Damon: You're afraid of me. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess. Stefan finally 'fessed up.
Elena: Stay away from me.
Damon: Hey, there's no need to be rude. I'm just looking for Stefan. May I come in? Oh, wait. Of course I can. I've been invited. We can cut to the chase if you want. I'm not gonna kill you right now. That wouldn't serve my greater agenda. So...Where's Stefan?
Elena: He's out looking for Vicki.
Damon: Don't look at me with those judgey little eyes. Girl's gonna thank me for what I did to her.
Elena: Did you thank Katherine?
Damon: Mmm. Got the whole life story, huh?
Elena: I got enough.
Damon: Oh, I doubt that. Tell my brother I'm looking for him. Oh, tip for later, be careful who you invite in the house.
Cemetery
Stefan: Vicki.
Vicki: I'm starting to remember things, what he is, what he said. I remember you. The hospital, the...the rooftop, it's all coming back.
Stefan: I'm so sorry. Damon had no right to do this to you.
Vicki: He said that I need to feed. What will happen if i don't?
Stefan: You'll fade quickly...And then it'll all just be over.
Vicki: I'll be dead.
Stefan: Hey.
Vicki: I don't want this.
Stefan: I know. It'll be ok. You're gonna be ok. I can help you.
Vicki: Is it better? Is it better? Will I be better? I wanna go home. Will you take me home?
Stefan: Ok.


Stefan: Ahh!
Vicki: No!


Damon: It's wood. They know. If anyone's gonna kill you, it's gonna be me. My ring.


Stefan: No! No! Vicki!
Vicki: I'm sorry.
Damon: Oops.




Sheriff Forbes: Oh god...The watch. Find the watch.
Gilbert Residence


Elena: You're bleeding.
Stefan: No, it's ok. It's ok. I'm ok.
Stefan: I couldn't stop her. I tried.
Elena: What does that mean?
Stefan: She fed, and then I lost her.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: I'll take care of it. I'll find her, and I will show her that she can live like I do. I will make sure that she does not hurt anybody, Elena. I promise you.
Elena: What do I tell my brother and...and Matt?
Stefan: We'll come up with a story.
Elena: You mean we'll come up with a lie.
Stefan: I'm so sorry.
Elena: I gave you today just like you asked. And I understand that you would never do anything to hurt me, and I promise I will keep your secret, but...I can't be with you, Stefan. I'm sorry. I...I just can't...


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Sorry.
Jeremy: Oh, no, it's cool, I'm done.
Elena: You're up early. Where are you going?
Jeremy: Police station. They're organizing the search party for Vicki, so...
Elena: Wait. Shouldn't you be going to school?
Jeremy: What? You're kidding me, right?
Elena: You shouldn't skip school. If they find her, we'll know. That's what cellphones are for.
Jeremy: Yeah, your lips keep movin'. I don't know why.
Mystic Falls High


Matt: Yeah?
Vicki: Matty?
Matt: Vicki, where are you? Are you okay?
Vicki: Yeah. I'm okay.
Matt: Tell me where you are, and I'll come get you.
Vicki: No. Matty, I just need some time to figure things out. Just know that I am okay, okay? Please don't worry about me.


Salvatore Boarding House
Vicki: I don't understand why I have to stay cooped up here. Why can't I just go home?
Stefan: Because you're changing, Vicki, and it's not something you wanna do alone.
Damon: There's nothin' about that Logan guy I killed in here. Not a word. Someone's covering it up.
Vicki: What is that?
Damon: This is a very special, very old compass. What was Logan Fell doing with it? Aren't you curious?
Stefan: Well, if you're so worried that somebody's onto you, why don't you just leave town, Damon?
Damon: We should all be worried.
Vicki: Hey, um, I'm hungry. Do you have anything to eat?
Stefan: Here.


Vicki: What is it?
Stefan: It's what you're craving.
Damon: Heh. Don't lie to the girl. It's so not what you're craving, but it'll do in a pinch, right, Stef?
Vicki: What is it?
Damon: Yeah, what is it? Is it a skunk? Saint Bernard? Bambi?
Stefan: Go on. Give it a try.
Damon: She's new. She needs people blood. She can't sustain on that stuff.
Vicki: Yeah, why can't I have people blood?
Damon: Yeah.
Stefan: Because it's wrong to pray on innocent people, Vicki.
Damon: You don't have to kill to feed. Just find someone really tasty and then erase their memory after wards. It's so easy.
Stefan: No, no, no. There's no guarantee that you can control yourself, okay? It takes years to learn that. You could easily kill somebody, and then you have to carry that with you for the rest of your life, which, if I haven't made clear, is eternity.
Damon: Don't listen to him. He walks on a moral plane way out of our eye line. I say snatch, eat, erase.
Stefan: Hey, look at me. We choose our own path. Our values and our actions, they define who we are.
Damon: Okay, count deepak. I am outta here.
Vicki: Can I have some more?


Elena: Is Stefan here?
Damon: Yep!
Elena: Where is he?
Damon: And good morning to you, little miss  I'm on a mission.
Elena: How can you be so arrogant and glib after everything that you've done?
Damon: And how can you be so brave and stupid to call a vampire arrogant and glib?
Elena: If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
Damon: Yes, you would.
Elena: But I'm not.
Damon: Yet.
Elena: Where is Stefan?
Damon: He's upstairs singing The rain in Spain. Knock yourself out.


Elena: Stefan? Stefan?
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: Where is Vicki?
Stefan: She's upstairs.
Elena: What happens now? Because my brother is out there searching for her with the rest of the town. What do I tell him?
Stefan: I'm working with her, but it's gonna take time. She's a very volatile and impulsive personality. She's a drug user. I mean, all that's gonna play a part in how she responds to this.
Elena: So, she's a vampire with issues? What am I supposed to do? Because I'm lying to everyone that I care about. What's gonna happen to her?
Stefan: I'm gonna keep her here with me until I know that she's safe.
Vicki: How long is that?
Stefan: We can talk about that later.
Elena: Hey, Vicki, How are you?
Vicki: How am I? You're kidding, right?
Gram's Residence
Bonnie: Was our family burned in the witch trials?
Grams: No, the girls that were persecuted in Salem were entirely innocent. You have to have more than ignorance to trap a real witch.
Bonnie: How did we end up in Mystic Falls?
Grams: Our family fled Salem in 1692 and relocated here. Our ancestors lived in secrecy for over a hundred years. It's important that we still do.
Bonnie: Grams, everybody knows you're a witch.
Grams: They also know it's absurd, can't be true. I'm just a kooky lady that teaches occult at the university. No ones really believes. They just poke fun. And let 'em. Don't let 'em know the truth.
Bonnie: Where's the witchcraft? I mean, you've been talking history for 2 days. I wanna get to the fun part.
Grams: It's not meant to be fun. It's real and it's serious, and you must understand it before you practice it. Aren't you late for school?
Mystic Grill


Mr Lockwood: We never should have trusted that Logan...weasel with the watch.
Mrs Lockwood: How many are we dealing with?
Mr Lockwood: Well, the coroner thinks one. Something about the wound radius and the jaw pattern.
Mrs Lockwood: Are we in danger? I mean, if it found the watch, then it knows we know, and could it come after us? A-and should I even be saying it? Or...or is it a he or a she?
Mr Lockwood: If it has any historical knowledge of the town, then it'll know where the watch came from, so yes, we could very much be in danger.
Mrs Lockwood: So what do we do?
Mr Lockwood: Just keep it quiet. We can't have the entire town aware of this. We need to find it before it finds us.


Mystic Falls High
Tyler: Hey man!
Matt: Hey!
Tyler: I heard they're putting together a search party for Vicki.
Matt: She just called. She's okay.
Tyler: Ooh good. That's great. I figured you must have been goin' out of your mind.
Matt: Little bit. Yeah.
Tyler: I was just gonna offer. You know, if there's anything I could do.
Matt: I appreciate it.
Caroline: I have got your costume. It's all here.
Bonnie: Seriously?
Caroline: Come on. Can someone please be excited that it's Halloween? I just wanna have fun, you know, just some silly, fluffy, Damon free fun.
Bonnie: Hey, isn't this the one you got from Damon?
Caroline: Yep. Wear it. Toss it. I don't care. I just want it gone. Hey, have you seen Elena? Do we know what she's wearing?
Bonnie: I was with Grams all weekend. I haven't talked to her. Maybe she's with Stefan.
Caroline: Riding to his castle on his white horse.
Bonnie: Don't be bitter. It provokes wrinkles.
Salvatore Boarding House
Stefan: Coffee is our friend. It's the caffeine. It circulate through our veins, and it warms our body so we're not so cold to the touch.
Vicki: Well, what if I wanna drink human blood?
Stefan: You're gonna have to learn to live with that urge and fight it on a daily basis one day at time.
Vicki: Oh god! Don't start with that whole 12 steps thing. School counselor has been down that road, and it doesn't work for me.
Stefan: It can work. It's your choice, Vicki.
Vicki: So you've never tasted human blood?
Stefan: Not in a long time.
Vicki: How long?
Stefan: Years and years. I'm not proud of my past behavior.
Vicki: Does this sketchy feeling ever go away? It's like I have a massive hangover. This daylight thing is a bitch. I need more blood. Where's your bathroom? I have to pee. Why do I have to pee? I thought I was dead.


Stefan: I'm going to, uh...I'm gonna get her some more. All right. I'll be quick.


Vicki: False alarm. My body's feeling really funky. It's a good funk, but it's weird.
Elena: Hmm, who are you calling?
Vicki: Jeremy.
Elena: Vicki, you can't see Jeremy anymore.
Vicki: Oh come on don't you start. I'm gonna see whoever I wanna see.
Elena: Even though you could hurt him?
Vicki: I would never hurt Jeremy.
Elena: I know you think that but I can't take that risk. You're gonna have to let Jeremy go now.
Vicki: Oh really? And how long have you been preparing the you're not good enough speech? I'm assuming it predates the whole vampire thing.
Elena: All I am saying is Jeremy is not getting involved in any of this. I mean it, Vicki.
Vicki: Or what? 
Vicki: Let's get one thing straight, you perky little bitch. You had my brother whipped for fifteen years. Fifteen years and then you dumped him. When I look at you that is all I see, just so you know. And I'm gonna see Jeremy whenever I wanna see Jeremy, because I have some fun new toys to play with, and I won't think twice about ripping your little head off. You got it?




Elena: She threatened me.
Stefan: She's on edge. Imagine every sense in your body operating at super speed. I mean, she's uncomfortable in her own skin. And then when you throw in her other issues...
Elena: How long before it settles? Hours? Days? Weeks?
Stefan: There's no rule book.
Elena: Well, how long before you learned to control it?
Stefan: A while, But I didn't have anybody helping me. I had to do it on my own. The thing is it's hard to resist certain people especially when you're new, it's difficult to separate your feelings. Love, lust, anger, desire...it can all blur into one urge, hunger.
Elena: What does that mean?
Stefan: It means that Jeremy can't see her, not now. She might not be able to resist him, and she could hurt him.
Elena: Or worse.
Stefan: I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.
Elena: I need to get going.
Stefan: Elena...
Elena: Please Stefan. There's only so much I can take.


Damon: What are you doing?
Vicki: Just contemplating the next hundred years. Why did you do it?
Damon: I was...bored.
Vicki: You did this to me out of boredom?
Damon: It's one of the pitfalls of eternity.
Vicki: Now I'm bored. And all I can think about is blood. I just want some blood. I can't think about anything else. What is that about?
Damon: That'll ease up. You've just been cooped up all day. Let's go.
Vicki: Where?
Damon: Your life was pathetic. Your afterlife doesn't have to be.
Stefan: What are you doing?
Damon: She's been cooped up in your room all day. She's not Anne Frank.
Stefan: No no. Hey hey...Now's not the time for this.
Damon: If you're gonna teach her. Teach her. Show her what it's all about.
Stefan: She could hurt someone.
Damon: I'm not takin' her to Disneyland. We're going in the front yard. Come on.
Stefan: Bad idea Damon.
Damon: She's a vampire Stefan, she should know the perks.
Vicki: Like what?
Damon: Like....


Vicki: Whoa. How did you do that? Ho ho ho ho.
Damon: Come on Vicki, live a little. No pun intended.


Damon: Uh...my bad.
Donovan Residence


Vicki: Matt?
Matt: Vicki? Is that you?
Vicki: Hey.
Matt: Get in here.


Vicki: In a minute. I...
Matt: Please come inside. I've been worried. Thank God you're okay. Where were you, Vic?
Vicki: It's no big deal. Drop it already.
Matt: Three people were murdered in the woods. The cops were lookin' for you. They wanna question you.
Vicki: They know where I live.
Matt: Everyone was worried about you.
Vicki: I'm back now. Just let it go.
Matt: Are you kidding? I had a freakin' search party out lookin' for you while you were off on your crazy drug trip, and you want me to let it go?
Vicki: My head hurts.
Matt: You think?


Matt: Stefan, what are you doing here?
Stefan: Is Vicki home?
Matt: Yeah.
Stefan: Can I see her, please?
Vicki: Don't let him in. I don't want him in here.
Matt: Did he do something to you?
Vicki: No, I just don't want him in here.
Stefan: Just let me come in so I can explain myself.
Matt: Look, I don't know what's going on but I think you should leave now.
Stefan: Matt...
Matt: Please, now, Stefan.
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: You gotta call me, Vic. I don't get it. What's going on with you? Just...just call me please.
Elena: Hey. So, um, do you wanna hang out tonight? We could go to the, uh, Halloween thing at school. Could be fun!
Jeremy: Cool. Sure. Sounds uh...sounds fun. Can't wait.
Elena: I know you're upset about Vicki. I heard she called Matt. But you can't be with her. She needs to get better. The best thing you can do for her is let her go.
Jeremy: What does that even mean, let her go? Oh, okay, sure. Since we're such experts on letting people go, right?
Elena: I know you may not see it, but trust me Jer. It's for the best.
Jeremy: Look, for months after mom and dad died, I felt like crap, like nothing really even mattered crap. Now all of a sudden, I get these moments and things started to feel just a little bit better, and Vicki was in every single of 'em. So you may not see it, but trust me. Keeping me away from her is not for the best.


Mystic Falls High


Tyler: Cider for the ladies. It's a Lockwood special.
Bonnie: No way. Last year I was hung over until Thanksgiving.
Caroline: Lightweight. I am going to drink until someone is hot enough to make out with.
Tyler: Sounds like a plan.
Mystic Grill


Mr Lockwood: How many martinis have you had?
Mrs Lockwood: Oh. Don't start with me.
Mr Lockwood: Can we go now? We're late for the Halloween party. Let's go.
Mrs Lockwood: So go ahead. I'd like to finish my drink.
Damon: Let me guess. Daisy Buchanan. I love a good gatsby look.
Mrs Lockwood: I've met you before. Aren't you Caroline Forbes' boyfriend?
Damon: Ah, she had a schoolgirl crush on me but...It was cute but I had to let her down easy.
Mrs Lockwood: It's Damon, right?
Damon: Ah, you remember?
Mrs Lockwood: Well, you have a face that's hard to forget. What's your last name Damon?
Damon: Salvatore.
Mrs Lockwood: Salvatore.
Damon: Mm hmm.
Mrs Lockwood: Are you any relation to Zach?
Damon: Zach's my uncle. How do you know Zach?


Mrs Lockwood: Are you okay?
Damon: Yeah. I think there's something in my eye.
Mrs Lockwood: Well, I know Zach from the Founder's Council. You know the Salvatores were one of this town's original settlers.
Damon: Yes, they were. I wasn't aware that Zach was a member. I just recently moved back home and haven't really had a chance to meet many of his friends.
Mrs Lockwood: Well, will you tell him to return my calls? I've left several messages.
Damon: Zach went out of town for a bit. But if it's about the Vervain...
Mrs Lockwood: You know about the Vervain?
Damon: Well, I'm a Salvatore. Of course I do.
Mrs Lockwood: Of course.
Damon: Hmm. Cheers.
Mystic Falls High


Kids: Aah aah!
Matt: You went with last year's costume too, huh?
Elena: Yeah. I didn't know that I was coming till an hour ago.
Matt: Me neither. And you're going as...you?
Elena: He's not talking to me right now. We got into fight.
Matt: Yeah, I got into it with Vic too, when she got home. I'm trying not to smother her tonight, but part of me didn't wanna let her out of my sight.
Elena: She's here?
Matt: Yeah, you can't miss her. She's a vampire.
Elena: Where did Jeremy go?
Matt: Elena what's the matter?
Elena: I..I've gotta find him.


Vicki: What, you're following me now?
Stefan: You didn't really give me a much of choice.
Vicki: Let me out of here.
Stefan: You shouldn't be here Vicki. Crowds like this, it make it even harder for you to keep yourself under control.
Vicki: I'm fine.
Stefan: Really?
Vicki: Mmm hmm.
Stefan: No headache? Your stomach's not screaming at you? You're not feeling lightheaded or anxious or cranky like if someone looks at you the wrong way you could just rip their head off? Do you wanna know what that's called? It's called hunger and it's only gonna get worse and worse every minute that you pretend like it's not controlling you.
Mystic Grill
Damon: So you need vervain?
Mrs Lockwood: Yes. my husband and I only have left what his parents left him, And Zach had promised that he could supply us with more.
Damon: Well, I talk to him all the time. So why don't I just ask him?
Mrs Lockwood: Hmm.
Damon: Mmm. How much do you need? I mean, how many people, you think?
Mrs Lockwood: Well, there's our children, of course.
Damon: Of course.
Mrs Lockwood: And, um, friends, family, and everyone on the council.
Damon: The council?
Mrs Lockwood: Zach knows how many. But I am so late. My husband is not going to be happy with me.
Damon: Well, are you happy with your husband?
Mrs Lockwood: You're flirting with me.
Damon: You flirted with me first.
Mrs Lockwood: True.
Damon: Let me escort you to the school. It's not safe out there alone. I mean, I've seen 10 vampires tonight.
Mrs Lockwood: Heh. well, if only the real ones were as easy to find.
Damon: How's that search goin'?
Mrs Lockwood: Oh, we had the founder's party, and anyone who arrived during the day was eliminated as a suspect.
Damon: Oh.
Mrs Lockwood: And all the rest were just dead ends, so mmm mmm, I gotta go.
Damon: Okay.
Mystic Falls High


Elena: Thank God.
Stefan: What's the matter?
Elena: I lost track of Jeremy. I was worried.
Matt: What's goin' on?
Stefan: Hey. uh, everything's fine.
Vicki: I told you to quit bothering me.
Elena: No. Vicki, don't do this.
Vicki: Matt, he won't leave me alone.
Matt: You need to back off, man.
Elena: Matt, it's...it's okay.
Matt: No, it's not okay. What the hell is your problem?
Elena: Stefan. She's gone.
Stefan: I'm trying to help her.


Jeremy: Whoa. Vic, you scared the hell out of me.
Vicki: Sorry. I'm sorry.




Damon: So where...where'd Caroline run off to?
Bonnie: Do yourself a favor, Damon, and don't ask me about Caroline.
Damon: Oh, Bonnie. So loyal.
Bonnie: Just stay away from her.


Damon: Where'd you get that?
Bonnie: From a friend.
Damon: Caroline. You know that's mine, don't you?
Bonnie: Not anymore.
Damon: Funny. I'd like it back, please.
Bonnie: I'm not giving it to you. I'll give it to Caroline, and she can give it to you if she feels like it.
Damon: Or I could just take it right now.




Elena: Jeremy.
Jeremy: I was so worried about you.
Vicki: I'm fine now, but...I gotta leave.
Jeremy: Wh...what? Where?
Vicki: I gotta get out of here, Jer. I just...I can't live at home with Matt. He just doesn't get it.
Jeremy: No, you can't. You can't just leave.
Vicki: Come with me. If you come with me, we can be together forever.


Jeremy: Okay. Yeah. Ow. You're taking that costume a little too far. What? What is it? Vicki! Vicki, what the hell?! Oh, my god. No! stop! Vicki! No! Ah!


Elena: Vicki, no!


Jeremy: Vicki!


Stefan: Go. get inside. Go!


Elena: Ah!!


Jeremy: Vicki! Vicki! Vicki! Vicki!


Elena: Get him out of here.


Damon: What?
Stefan: I Need your help.


Gram's Residence
Grams: What happened to you?
Bonnie: I did something. I don't know. It came from my necklace.
Grams: Where'd you get that?
Bonnie: It's part of my costume. It's a piece of junk.
Grams: That piece of junk belonged to one of the most powerful witches of our family. Let me show you. There she is. Emily Bennett. Your great-great-great-great-grandmother. And there's your necklace.
Mystic Falls High


Damon: You should go. I got this.
Elena: You did this. This is your fault.
Damon: You confuse me for someone with remorse.


Damon: None of this matters to me. None of it.
Elena: People die around you. How could it not matter? It matters, and you know it.


Damon: You need to leave. Your wounds are bleeding and you need to leave.


Matt: Elena! Hey, have you seen...Whoa. wh...what happened?
Elena: Nothing. some idiot with some fake blood got me. I'm gonna go home and shower.
Matt: I...I can't find Vicki. She totally bailed on me.
Elena: I don't know where she is.
Matt: Is this what I'm in for, a lifetime of worrying about her?
Elena: You're a good brother, Matt.
Matt: Yeah, Maybe she went home.
Elena: Maybe.
Matt: Okay.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Where is he?
Stefan: Inside.


Elena: Do you understand what happened tonight?
Jeremy: No. I don't understand. I mean, I know what I saw, but...I don't understand.
Elena: She was going to kill me.
Jeremy: Now she's dead. Vicki's dead.
Elena: I'm so sorry, Jer.
Jeremy: Make it stop. It hurts.
Elena: Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. it's okay.
Jeremy: Why does everybody have to die on me?
Elena: Oh, my god. come here.




Elena: Are you okay?
Stefan: I, uh...I wanted to help her. But instead, uh...How's he doin'?
Elena: He's a mess. I don't want him going through this again. He's just a kid.
Stefan: Elena, what can I do? I...What can I do to help? I'll do anything.
Elena: Can you make him forget?
Stefan: Elena...
Elena: Stefan, please. I don't know how he'll ever get past this. I just want him to forget everything that happened.
Stefan: If I did it, there's no guarantee that it would work...Because of who I am. Because of how I live. I don't have the ability to do it right.
Damon: I can do it. If this is what you want...I'll do it.
Elena: It's what I want.
Damon: What do you want him to know?
Elena: I want you to tell him that Vicki left town and she's not coming back. That he shouldn't look for her or worry about her. He's gonna miss her, but he knows it's for the best.


Elena: Part of me wishes that I could forget, too...Forget meeting you, finding out what you are and everything that's happened since.
Stefan: Is that what you want?
Elena: Yes, it is. Because I don't want it to be like this. I don't wanna feel like this. But I can't. With everything that's happened...I can't lose the way I feel about you.


Damon: It's done.


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: Damon?


Stefan: Lexi!?
Lexi: Hi.
Stefan: What are you doing here?
Lexi:  How could you even ask that?
Stefan: I missed you.
Lexi: Happy Birthday.


Lexi: Stop. I don't know, some freak shot at me with wooden bullets. I bail in under sixty. And why is a news reporter hunting vampires?
Stefan: I don't know who knows about us. That guy did. There could be others. Do me a favor, while you're here, please be careful.
Lexi: Why stay? I'm headed to New York for the weekend. Bon Jovi in the Garden. Wanted dead or alive, it's our theme song. It'll be a blast.
Stefan: Do you think he would actually remember us? That was a pretty crazy weekend huh?
Lexi: We can make him remember us. Come on! Let's go. I mean, what's keeping you here?
Stefan: I told you, her name is Elena.
Lexi: Let's hope she's better than the last girl you got all sprung over. 
Stefan:  You didn't even know Katherine.
Lexi: 'Cause if I did I'd kick her ass. Little bitch. Speaking of...where's Damon?
Stefan: Inflicting misery somewhere. You gonna be okay here alone? 'Cause I got some things I gotta take care of.
Lexi: It's not exactly like I can go anywhere. And you and Damon are the only ones with these nifty little daylight rings. I have a mood ring from '75! Trade ya?
Stefan: Doesn't work that way and you know it.
Lexi: Yeah.
Stefan: Hey Lex. I'm really glad that you came here.
Lexi: What are we doing for your birthday? It's not everyday a guy turns a hundred and sixty-two years old.
Stefan:  Really?
Lexi: Oh yeah.

Sheriff's Office


Sheriff Forbes: Where did Vicki say she was going?
Jeremy: She didn't.
Sheriff Forbes: Did she tell her brother where she was going?
Matt: No she didn't say anything to me. She told Jeremy to tell me that she was leaving town.
Sheriff Forbes: Is there anyone I can talk to that may know what happened to her prior to her leaving town?
Matt: Stefan Salvatore may know. He came by the house to see her but she wouldn't talk to him.
Sheriff Forbes: What was he doing there?
Stefan: I was trying to help her, I knew that Elena was worried about her brother, he was dating Vicki and she had a drug problems, so I tried to help.
Sheriff Forbes: So you got involved because Elena asked you to?
Elena: I asked Stefan to help. I thought that, by helping Vicki, he was helping my brother.
Sheriff Forbes: What was her behavior like those last few days before she left?
Matt: Up and down, very sketchy, like she was coming down from some major partying.
Sheriff Forbes: Any signs of aggression or violence?
Jeremy: None that I remember.
Stefan: No.
Elena: No.
Sheriff Forbes: So you believe Vicki really has left town?
Matt: Yes.
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: Yes.
Jeremy: I'll miss her but....I think it's for the best.


Stefan: I was trying to help her Matt. That's all.


Elena:  I'll meet you guys at the car.
Jenna: Ok. 
Stefan: You okay?
Elena: I don't think the Sheriff suspected anything. Jeremy had no memory at all. All he knew was what Damon made him know.
Stefan: Thank you.
Elena: I can't do this Stefan. Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy, all I think is that Vicki is never gonna come back. And they'll never know why. Around you people get hurt and people die. I can't I just...it's just too much....
Stefan: Why don't we go somewhere and talk about it.
Elena: No, Stefan you have to stay away from me.
Salvatore Boarding House


Lexi:  Hmmm, Huh.


Damon: Boo.
Lexi: 
Damon: Hello Lexi. What an unexpected surprise.
Lexi: Unexpected surprise? I think the wrong brother went back to high school.
Damon: How long are you here for?
Lexi: Just for Stefan's B-Day.
Damon: Oh, you mean you didn't come all this way to see me?
Lexi:  That's it Damon. After a century I finally realize death means nothing without you. Do me.
Damon: Why are you so mean to me?
Lexi: Uh, have you met you? You're not a nice person.
Damon: Because I'm a vampire.
Lexi: But you're only the bad parts.
Damon: Teach me to be good.


Lexi: I'm older and that means stronger.
Damon:  Sorry.
Lexi: Don't ruin my time with Stefan, 'cause I'll hurt you. And you know I can do it.
Damon: Yeah.


Gram's Residence


Grams: You leavin'?
Bonnie: Dad doesn't like it when I stay here too much.
Grams: Because he misses you or because he doesn't trust me. Your father's problem is he lacks imagination. He thinks I fill your head with my witchy juju.
Bonnie: He's right.
Grams: He's always right, that's his other problem.  Uh-uh. You need to be wearing that.
Bonnie: I gotta give it back to Caroline. It doesn't belong to me.
Grams: Yes, it does. It was your ancestor's and now it's yours.
Bonnie: Emily was your ancestor too, why don't you wear it?
Grams: Because it didn't find me, it found you, protected you. A witch's talisman is a powerful tool, don't be givin' that back to anybody.
Bonnie: I just wish it was prettier.
Gilbert Residence


Jenna: You're wallowing.
Elena: So are you.
Jenna: My wallow is legitimate. I was dumped.
Elena: Yeah. Well Logan's a jerk.
Jenna: You didn't get a brush-off e-mail say: I'm leaving town. See ya.
Jeremy: Wanna keep it down over there?
Jenna: Why? What are you doing?
Jeremy: Homework.
Elena: Since when do you do homework?
Jeremy: I gotta finish this. I'm way behind and I have a quiz tomorrow so...


Elena: What do you think? Alien?
Jenna: Some sort of replicant.
Jeremy: He can hear you.
Sheriff's Office


Sheriff Forbes: Yeah. Send him in.  Mister Salvatore, come on in. Could you get the door for me?
Damon: Sure.
Sheriff Forbes: I understand from Mrs. Lockwood that your uncle is out the town.
Damon: Yes he is. But I spoke with Zach. He filled me in and asked if I could bring this to you.


Sheriff Forbes: Vervain.
Damon: That's all we have at the moment, I hope it's enough.
Sheriff Forbes: It's a small circle...Founding families, a few city officials.
Damon: And your deputies, of course right? Are we any closer?
Sheriff Forbes: I think our facts are wrong. We've always believed that vampires can only come out in the dark. What if that's changed?
Damon: So is that even possible?
Sheriff Forbes: We've exhausted every other option. We have to consider the vampire may be walking around during the day. Right in front of us.
Damon: Hm. So what's the next step?
Sheriff Forbes: We're now looking at anyone new to town, since the deaths began. Should turn up a suspect or two.
Damon: And I, of course, will do anything I can to help.
Gilbert Residence


Bonnie: You up?
Elena: No.  No, no!
Bonnie: Why haven't you called me back?
Elena: I'm sorry.
Bonnie: Are you gonna stay in there forever?
Elena: Yep.
Bonnie: Move over.  I'm officially worried. What's going on?
Elena: I'm tired of thinking...of talking I...
Bonnie: Can I get a one-line version so I can at least pretend to be helpful?
Elena: Stefan and I broke up.
Bonnie: I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Right stupid question. I know I've been kind of MIA when you need me the most. I suck.
Elena: You wanna make it up to me. Get my mind off of it.
Bonnie: Just remember you asked for it.


Elena: Hey!
Bonnie: Be patient.
Elena: OK.
Bonnie: I need to swear you to secrecy.
Elena: It's kind of a bad week for that kind of stuff.
Bonnie: Swear, 'cause I'm not supposed to be showing you this.
Elena: OK, I swear.
Bonnie: There's no windows open, right?
Elena: Right.
Bonnie: There's no fan. No air conditioning.
Elena: None. What are you doing?
Bonnie: Grams just showed me this. You're gonna love it. You ready?
Elena: Bonnie what's going on?


Bonnie: It's true Elena. Everything my Grams told me. It's impossible and it's true. I'm a witch.
Elena: I believe you.
Mystic Grill


Caroline: Look dungeon boy I'm done being your little slave girl. You seriously hurt me, and I will be damned if you think..  Oh my god where have you been? It's really good to see you.
Damon: Much better. You wanna throw a party here at the grill tonight.
Caroline: Oh, why don't you do it?
Damon: Because then Stefan and his BFF won't come. I need a lot of people. Big crowd. Invite everyone.
Caroline: And why am I having this party?
Damon: Because you're gonna help me solve this town's little vampire problem. And I want my crystal back.
Caroline: But Bonnie has it.
Damon: I know that. Get it from her.
Salvatore Boarding House
Lexi: So this Elena girl. She'll come around. I'm sure of it. Have you had sex yet?
Stefan: No
Lexi: Sex always works. I mean you'll rock her world so hard with your vamp sex, she'll be yours forever.
Stefan: Yeah, but see, this isn't about sex or...or compulsion or any of our other tricks. She has to want to be with me on her own terms.
Lexi: Wow. That sounded all mature and grown-up.
Stefan: I'm not getting any older.


Lexi: Want some?
Stefan: No. Thank you.
Lexi: Relax I didn't kill anyone for it. This phlebotomist I went out with a few times, he's my supplier.  Oh don't judge, ok? Listen I tried the animal diet; lasted three weeks.
Stefan: It doesn't matter. Cause if I started again...I just don't know if...
Lexi: You could stop.
Stefan: Lexi, I'd never judge you.
Lexi: I'm just jealous of your restraint. I have none. I delight in hedonism. Speaking of which, what are we doing tonight?


Damon: Funny you should ask.
Lexi: Well I wasn't asking you.
Damon: There's a party at the grill. You'll love it. Banquettes, Tacky wait staff, All of Stefan's friends.
Stefan: Yeah, I don't want a Birthday party.
Damon: Well, It's not for you. It's a party party. No one's gonna know it's your birthday. Caroline's throwing it.
Stefan: Damon, stay away from Caroline.
Damon: We're friends it's cool. It's important for the town to see us out and about like normal folk. We need to blend. 
Lexi: Let's Go.  Please?
Gilbert Residence
Bonnie: It's Weird huh? After all This times joking about being psychic. I really am a witch. You don't think I'm a freak now, do you?
Elena: No of course not. Bonnie I just...don't understand though. If your Grams asked you to keep all this a secret, why did you tell me?
Bonnie: You're my best friend. I can't keep secrets from you.
Salvatore Boarding House


Lexi: I'm almost ready.
Stefan: I can't believe you actually think that we should go to this thing.
Lexi: It's not like I'm asking you to run outside midday without your ring. I mean, seriously, it's a party.
Stefan: A party that Damon wants us to go to, you know? So my question is why? I think he's up to something.
Lexi: Who cares? What can he possibly of all those people in a public place?
Stefan: He knows how to keep a low profile, believe me.
Lexi: Okay so he'll behave. Come on. One day a year I get you, one day that you're not brooding and existing in your own head.
Stefan: It's my birthday, yeah?
Lexi: It's my day. And that guy that jump naked in the Trevi fountain and got drunk on the torch of the statue of Liberty, that guy can take a break from all of his worrying for one night and go to a stupid party. So quit your whining  and go get ready.
Stefan:  Fine.


Lexi: It's open! Come on in.


Lexi:  Oh my God! How...uh- wh-...Who?
Elena: I'm Elena. Who are you?
Lexi: Lexi, a friend of Stefan's.
Elena: Is he here?
Lexi: He's in the shower. Do you want to wait?
Elena: No.
Lexi: I'll tell him you stopped by.
Elena: That's okay. 


Lexi: Are you out of your freaking mind?
Stefan: What are you talking about?
Lexi: I just met Elena . You have some serious explaining to do.


Lexi: You have some serious emotional damage.
Stefan: No, it's not what you think. She's not Katherine.
Lexi: Then they're related, 'cause they can be twins.
Stefan: I don't know.
Lexi: You don't know or you didn't find out?
Stefan: No. Maybe. I don't want to know. I have no desire to tie Elena to Katherine.  Ok yes, yes the resemblance is what drew me in. But that's it. Katherine and Elena may look the same on the outside but on the inside they are completely different.
Lexi: So Elena is not a raging Bitch then, huh?
Stefan: No. Elena is...Elena's warm and she's...she's kind, and she's caring, and she's selfless, and it's real. And honestly when I'm around her, I...I completely forget what I am.
Lexi: Oh my god! You're in love with her.
Stefan: Yeah. Yeah, I am.
Mystic Grill


Caroline: Amazing party right?
Damon: Glad you thought of it.
Caroline: Well, are you having a good time?
Damon: Do you have my crystal?
Caroline: No.
Damon: Then I'm not having a good time.


Damon: Where's my brother?
Lexi: He said he'd meet me here.
Damon: Buy you a,  
Gilbert Residence


Stefan: Hey.
Elena: What are you doing here?
Stefan: Lexi said that you came by and you seemed upset.
Elena: Right. The girl in the towel.
Stefan: The towel?...Oh no no no no not like that, she's not exactly a girl--Lexi's just 350 years old
Elena: You mean she's a...
Stefan: And she's my oldest friend. Nothing romantic. Ever.
Elena: Oh, okay, well....she kept staring at me. It was weird.
Stefan: Yeah well I've talk about you a lot so...I guess she felt like she knew you.So why'd you come by?
Elena: I-uh...it was a mistake.
Stefan: Elena talk to me.
Elena: I can't. Stefan I can't, and that's the problem. I'm keeping all these secrets from everyone. I can't even tell my best friend. Do you know how hard that is? It's like I need to talk to someone but the only person I can talk to is you....and...
Stefan: I want you to know that I will always be here for you. You can come to me about anything okay?
Elena: Well, thank you for coming by.
Stefan: Hey, do you need a ride to the grill tonight?
Elena: Are you going to Caroline's party?
Stefan: Lexi's dragging me and...it's my birthday.
Elena: Really? Wow-um, happy birthday then.
Stefan: Thank you.
Elena: Actually I, I think I'm gonna stay in tonight.
Stefan: Well have a...have a good night.
Mystic Grill


Caroline: Bonnie I've been looking for you. I'm totally sorry to do this I know it's so Indian giver and I know we're not even supposed to say that anymore but I need my crystal back.
Bonnie: Why? You said you hated it.
Caroline: Then I saw it on you and I realize how great it is, and I've got three outfits I can coordinate it with so....
Bonnie: I can't give it back to you.
Caroline: Well, I didn't want to tell you this but I'm your friend, when you wear it makes you look fat. There I said it, but it's because I'm your friend so...
Bonnie: I'm sorry Caroline, I can't.
Caroline: What do you mean you can't? Bonnie it's mine.
Bonnie: I thought you said it was Damon's.
Caroline: It is.
Bonnie: So he's the one who really wants it back.
Caroline: No. Maybe, just... Are you wearing polyester?
Bonnie: You were really gonna pull it from my neck. What the hell is wrong with you? 
Caroline: Argh!


Stefan: Matt, just hear me out please. I was just trying to help Vicki. I went through something similar once, I'm really sorry.
Matt: Don't be. It's not the first time she's run off. Turns out Vicki's just like our mother; I can't count on either of them. Thanks for trying.


Damon: Where is it?
Caroline: Bonnie won't give it to me.
Damon: So rip it off her neck.
Caroline: I tried. It shocked me.
Damon: Damn it! Why does it do that? I need that crystal.
Caroline: Why are you being like this? I'm so good to you and I'd do anything. It's just some stupid necklace.
Damon: No, you are the only stupid thing here. And shallow. And useless. 


Lexi: Okay, I'm gonna need a little more foot movement.
Stefan: Yeah, not really interested in making a fool out of myself.
Lexi: Come on, you're not that bad.
Stefan: Do me a favor. Tell me if you see Damon with his camera phone.
Lexi: Right.


Girl: Where are we going?
Boy: No one's gonna see us....


Girl: Did you hear something?
Boy: No, it's cool. There's no one coming down here.




Stefan: Woo!
Lexi: Nice!


Damon: Stefan smiles. Alert the media.
Elena: You haven't given him a lot of reasons to be happy lately.
Damon: Oh, you're right. Poor Stefan persecuted throughout eternity by his depraved brother; does it get tiring being so righteous?
Elena: It flares up in the presence of psychopaths.
Damon: Ouch! Well, consider this psychopath's feelings get hurt.
Elena: What did you do to my brother?
Damon: I'm gonna need a less vague question.
Elena: When you did what you did to Jeremy's memory of Vicki, what else did you do to him?
Damon: You asked me to take away his memory of fangs and all the bad stuff. You wanted me to take away his suffering.
Elena: But he's acting different. He seems okay with everything and a little too okay. I mean he's studying; he's not doing drugs; he's not drinking; are you sure you didn't do something else?
Damon: Elena, I took away the suffering.


Bonnie: Caroline.
Caroline: Don't talk to me.
Bonnie: Don't do that, let me explain.
Caroline: What is there to explain Bonnie? You got what you wanted...and something that doesn't even belong to you by the way and, I get called a shallow, useless waste of space.
Bonnie: Who said that to you?
Caroline: Who do you think?
Bonnie: You know that not true. Don't let him treat you like that.
Caroline: As opposed to how my best friend treats me. 


Girl:  Help me.




Lexi: Two shots of tequila.  Make that three.
Barman: I need to see some ID.
Lexi: No you don't. 
Barman: That'll be, 
Lexi: Free!
Barman: On the house.
Lexi: Thanks!


Lexi: Oh! The famous Elena.
Elena: Towel girl.
Lexi: I've been called worse. Here. 
Elena:  I didn't know that you guys could drink.
Lexi: Oh yeah, it helps curb the cravings, but makes for a lot of lushy vamps.
Elena:  You know, I've never seen Stefan drunk. He always seem so...
Lexi: Uptight?
Elena: Yeah.
Lexi: Yeah.
Elena: But not with you.
Lexi: Well that the benefit of knowing someone for over a hundred years. You can just be yourself.
Elena: Yeah, he can't be himself with me.
Lexi: Well not yet. The first step was him telling you. The rest comes with time.
Elena: You seem so sure.
Lexi: The love of my life was human. He went through, what I imagine you're going through: denial, anger, et cetera. But at the end of the day, love really did conquer all.  Are you going to drink that?
Elena: Go for it.  I'm scared.
Lexi: But you're here...'cause you're crazy about him, I get it okay? I mean what's not to love.  Listen. Take it from someone who's been around a long time. When it's real, you can't walk away.
Elena: Hey Lexi. It was really nice meeting you.


Lexi: Yep, I drank yours, sorry.
Stefan:  Thank you.
Lexi:  I was feeling epic, whatever.


Sheriff Forbes: Keep this contained.
Officer: That's not all. 
Sheriff Forbes: Hey, hey. Did you see what did this?  Tell me everything you saw.


Elena: Hi!
Stefan: Hey, you came.
Elena: I couldn't miss your hundredth and...whatever birthday. 


Matt: Oh hey!
Caroline: I slim---I'm slipped. I slipped.
Matt: Hammered, huh?
Caroline: Well...a very nice but not handsome bartender was very kind to me tonight. Unlike the rest of the global universe. Are those curly fries?
Matt:  Bad night huh?
Caroline: Baddest. Am I shallow?
Matt: Is that a trick question?
Caroline: I don't mean to be. I wanna be deep. I wanna be, like...the abyss deep.
Matt: No offense, Care, but deep's really not your scene.
Caroline: That's true. I'm shallow, I am worst than shallow, I'm a kiddie pool!
Matt: You're not a kiddie pool. You're not a kiddie pool.
Caroline: Can I just go home okay?
Matt: I'll take you come on. You're okay.  She's still alright; Hold still, Hold still.


Sheriff Forbes: What happened is she okay?
Caroline: Like you care.
Sheriff Forbes: She's drunk?
Caroline: As a skunk.
Sheriff Forbes: Are they serving you in there?
Matt: I'll take her home. It's on my way. I haven't been drinking.
Sheriff Forbes: I would appreciate that, Matt, thank you.  You and I will discuss this later.
Caroline: Can't wait. 
Sheriff Forbes:  Don't let anybody else leave.


Lexi: All right, the shots are a bribe. I need you to answer a question. What are you really doing in Mystic Falls?
Damon: Have you tried The Brittle. It wins award.
Lexi: Cut the crap.
Damon: Okay, I have a diabolical master plan.
Lexi: What is it?
Damon: If I told you it wouldn't be very diabolical, now would it?


Sheriff Forbes: Look around let me know if you see anything.


Damon: What are you doing?!
Sheriff Forbes: Thank you for the vervain; now if you'll excuse me.


Stefan: Oh my god!
Elena: What is it?


Stefan: Excuse me, sorry.
Officer: Can't go out this way


Stefan:  Oh my god!
Lexi:  Why?
Damon:  It's part of the plan.


Damon: You okay?
Sheriff Forbes:  Thank you. Get her in the car quickly.
Damon: All right.


Barman: Lady, I checked everyone's IDs.
Sheriff Forbes: Yeah, apparently you didn't.


Sheriff Forbes: Pretty handy with that stake.
Damon: It just...reflex. I guess the adrenaline kicked in.
Sheriff Forbes: This nightmare is finally over.
Damon: Yeah call a lucky break with that witness, without her you wouldn't have been able to ID the vampire.
Sheriff Forbes: We're lucky. Well thank you again.
Damon: You're welcome.
Forbes Residence


Matt: You gonna be okay?
Caroline: No. Do you ever feel like there's not a person in the world that loves you?
Matt: Life can be a little rough.
Caroline: I just wish...
Matt: What?
Caroline: Wish that life was...different.
Matt: Yeah me too. 
Caroline: Please....don't leave me alone.


Mystic Grill


Elena:  Stefan! Stefan!
Stefan: He killed her! He killed Zach; he killed Tanner; he turned Vicki; I have to kill him!
Elena: No, you can't do that!
Stefan: Why are you trying to save him?! Elena he's never gonna change! Don't you see that?! He's never gonna change!
Elena: I'm not trying to save him, I'm trying to save you! You have no idea what this will do to you, please Stefan.
Stefan: Everywhere I've been, pain and death follow; Damon follows me. No more.
Elena: Stefan please. Please just-just talk to me; Let me be here for you. Talk to me.
Stefan: No. You were right to stay away from me. 
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Told you I'd take care of it.


Damon: Come on, I did this for you. To get them off our trail.
Stefan: You never do anything for anyone but yourself. 
Damon:  You missed!
Stefan: No. You saved my life. I'm sparing yours. We're even. And now we're done.


Benett Residence


Emily: It's coming.


Mystic Falls High School


Teacher: Today we're going to talk about shadow reckoning. This is a method of measuring heights by the sun's shadow. Let's say, for example, that we're going to measure the distance of a shadow. We're gonna take this measure here, measure the length, and we're going to multiply that by the height of the source. Building height can also be measured, using a clinometer, which we're going to make in class tomorrow.


Bonnie: Hello?


Fell's Church


Emily: Please, help me.
Bonnie: Who are you?
Emily: I'm Emily.  You know that. We're family.
Bonnie: Where am I?
Emily: This is where it started. And this is where it has to end.
Bonnie:  No. This isn't real.


Emily: Help me.
Mystic Falls High School


Bonnie:  What are you looking at? Turn around.


Fell's Church


Mystic Falls High School


Elena: Have you even talked to Bonnie?
Caroline: No, I'm mad at her. She needs to make the first move.
Elena: Be the bigger person.
Caroline: Impossible in her presence.
Elena: Why are you so pissed at her anyway?
Caroline: She's a thief, that's why. I gave her my necklace, and she refuses to give it back. It's a matter of principle.
Elena:  All right. Well, I tried. I'm officially out of it.
Caroline: Good. Your turn. Where's Stefan? Have you talked to him?
Elena: He's avoiding me.
Caroline: Why?
Elena:  I'll see you later.
Caroline: Bye.


Matt: Hey.
Caroline: Hey.




Alaric: Good Morning everyone. Alrighty.


Alaric: Alaric Saltzman. It's a mouthful, I know. Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. Saltzman is of German origins. My family emigrated here in 1755 to Texas. I, however, was born and raised in Boston. Now the name Alaric belongs to a very dead great-grandfather I will never be able to thank enough. You'll probably want to pronounce Alaric but it's Alaric, okay? So, you can call me Rick. I'm your new history teacher.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Rise and shine!  You'll be late for school.
Stefan: What? What are you doing?
Damon: Peace offering. Come on, you need it for blood circulation. Does dead flesh good!  All right. I'm sorry.
Stefan:  Step aside, please.
Damon: I got the town off our back. It was for the greater good, but I'm sorry. And, to prove it, I'm not gonna feed on a human.  For at least a week. I'll adopt a Stefan diet! Only nothing with feathers.
Stefan:  'Cause I realize that killing your closest and oldest friend is beyond evil, and yet somehow, it's worthy of humor.
Damon: Are you mimicking me?
Stefan:  Yes, Stefan. Now that the secret society of vampires haters is off our back, I can go back to my routine of How can I destroy Stefan's life this week?
Damon:  This is fun! I like this.
Stefan:  And I will finally reveal the ulterior motive behind my evil and diabolical return to Mystic Falls.
Damon: Yeah. I'm done. That's just like you, Damon. Always have to have the last word.
Mystic Falls High School


Bonnie: And then, I ended up at the remains of the old Fell's church before I woke up back in the woods.
Elena: And you always see your ancestor Emily?
Bonnie: Mhm. Do you believe in ghosts?
Elena: Two weeks ago I'd say no, but now...
Bonnie: Because I think I'm being haunted.
Elena: I don't get it. Why Emily?
Bonnie: Grams said she was a powerful witch back in the Civil War days, and that this medallion was hers. A witch's talisman.
Elena: And it all started when you got the necklace?
Bonnie: I think she's using it to communicate with me.
Elena: Okay, what does Grams say about it?
Bonnie: I can't call her. She's gonna tell me to embrace it. I don't want to embrace it, I want it to stop.


Jeremy: Hey Mr. Saltzman, I'm Jeremy Gilbert. You wanted to see me?
Alaric:  I'm not him. Clean slate. Now...let's talk about grades.
Jeremy: I know it's been a rough couple of months, but I've been trying to turn them around.
Alaric: Yeah, I saw that. But, the problem is, we're halfway through a semester and half a fail is still pretty bleak.  This is the part where you say to me, But what can I do to change that? I'm glad you asked! How do you feel about extra credit?
Jeremy:  Yeah, yeah, totally! Whatever.
Alaric:  Good! Write me a paper, then.
Jeremy: Okay. About what?
Alaric: History. Pick a topic, keep it local, and no Wikipedia-regurgita. These old towns have a rich history, so just get your hands dirty, make it sing and your back on track. Deal?
Jeremy:  That's a cool ring.
Alaric:  You've got a week.


Matt: Hey.
Caroline:  Hey, what is that?
Matt: What is what?
Caroline: The hey! That's twice. That is two heys. That--do you have any other words in your vocabulary?
Matt:  What's wrong with hey?
Caroline: It reeks of awkward subtext. You spent the night in my bed! There was cuddling! And then, you snuck out before dawn so you wouldn't have to face me, which I must say is a total Lame-Guy move that I did not appreciate. And now with the heys? Seriously? I mean, I may have been some pathetic, insecure mess after the party, but do not mistake that for me being a pushover, because I do not let guys mess with my head anymore.
Matt: I heard your mom in the morning, and I didn't want to get you in trouble. So, I went out the window.
Caroline: You went out the window? Another Lame-Guy move.
Matt: Your mom's the sheriff! And as for the heys, I'm pretty sure it's what I've said to you every day since the first grade. Trying to read something into it? Lame-Girl move.


Stefan: Hi.
Elena: You weren't in class, I was worried.
Stefan: Yeah, I got your messages, and I'm sorry I didn't get back to you, but what I wanna say shouldn't be said over the phone.
Elena: A simple I didn't kill my brother text would have sufficed.
Stefan: I didn't kill my brother, as much as he deserved it. He has you to thank you for that.
Elena: So, what did you wanna tell me?
Stefan: I won't be coming to school anymore. I'm gonna back off and keep my distance. It's the right thing to do.
Elena: Back off from school or from me?  Thank you for telling me.
Stefan: It's better this way.
Elena:  Yep. I got it.
Stefan: You're angry. That's good. It'll be easier if you hate me.


Damon: Okay, it's your last chance.
Bonnie:  I'm gonna scream.
Damon: Oh no, Don't do that. Let's stay on point. I want my necklace.
Bonnie: You can't have it.
Damon: I can't take it, but you can give it to me. I'm trying to help you, here.
Bonnie: I don't want your help.
Damon: You do want my help, and you don't even know it. You know why, you little witch? 'Cause you've stumbled into something you need to stumble out of.
Bonnie: Just leave me alone or I swear--
Damon: Don't! No threats. Look, A, you hurt me last time. B, I wish you no harm. Believe it or not, Bonnie, I wanna protect you. Let me help you get Emily off your back.
Bonnie:  How do you know about her?
Damon: I know a lot of things, and I know more about that crystal than you do, and I know that she's using it to creep inside of you. See how scared you are? And, you should be, because I will get that crystal, even if I have to wait for Emily to give it to me herself. So, next time she comes out to play, you tell her that a deal's a deal.


Bonnie's Car


Bonnie: He's bad news, Elena. He really scared me.
Elena: You need to stay as far away from Damon as possible.
Bonnie: I'm trying! He just keeps showing up.
Elena: I don't want you to be alone. You're sleeping at my place tonight, we can make a whole night out of it.


Elena: Whoa! Where are you going?


Elena: Are you okay?
Bonnie: Now I am. All my problems were because of that thing. I can't believe I didn't do that sooner.
Elena: What's your Grams gonna say?
Bonnie: Grams isn't the one being haunted by a hundred and fifty-year-old ghost, is she?
Elena:  Okay, then.
Mystic Grill


Jenna: I like a man who can dine alone. A quiet strength.
Jeremy: I thought you were still in that whole Logan-depression thing.
Jenna:  I've sworn off men forever, but it doesn't mean I can't observe them from a safe distance.
Jeremy: Well, I can introduce you.
Gilbert Residence


Elena: Hey. Thanks for coming. I wouldn't have called if it wasn't important.
Stefan: I know that.


Elena: He threatened her, Stefan.
Stefan: What would Damon want with Bonnie?
Elena: She has this necklace. Caroline got it from Damon, and she gave it to Bonnie, and now Damon wants it back. He's tormenting her.
Stefan: Over a necklace?
Elena: It's not just any necklace. It has to do with Bonnie's heritage. It belonged to one of her ancestors who lived here during the Civil War... When you and Damon lived here.
Stefan:  Her name was Emily. She was Katherine's handmaiden, and a witch.
Elena:  You know? About Bonnie?
Stefan: The first night that you invited me over for dinner, I made the connection.
Elena: And now Damon knows, and for some reason he wants that necklace.
Stefan: What does it look like?
Elena: It's an antique iron setting with a--
Stefan: --with an amber crystal. I know it. It belonged to Katherine. Emily gave it to her, which means that...
Elena: What?
Stefan:  I don't know, but I'm gonna find it out. Let me talk to Damon.
Elena: Will he tell you?
Stefan: I'll get it out of him.
Mystic Grill


Jenna: Have you picked a topic?
Jeremy: No, not yet. It's gotta be local and non-internet research, so...
Jenna: That's easy! You've got all your dad's stuff.
Jeremy: What stuff?
Jenna: How the Gilberts came over on the Mayflower stuff, all that family lineage from way back. Your dad really loved all that family history stuff. It's all boxed up in the closet.


Jeremy: Mr. Saltzman.
Alaric: Jeremy. What's up, man?
Jeremy: This is my aunt, Jenna.
Alaric:  Alaric Saltzman. It's nice to meet you.
Jenna: Jeremy was just telling me about his paper. Thanks for giving him another chance.
Alaric: It was my first day. I wanted to make a good impression.


Stefan: So, Stefan...You know, I've been thinking. I think we should start over, give this brother thing another chance. We used to do it, oh-so well, once upon time.
Damon: I don't, Damon. I can't trust you to be a nice guy. You kill everybody, and you're so mean. You're so mean, and... You're really hard to imitate, and then I have to go to that lesser place...
Stefan:  So, what's with the bottle?
Damon: I'm on edge. Crash diet. You know, I'm trying to keep a low profile.
Stefan: You could always just leave, find a new town to turn into your own personal Gas 'n' Sip.
Damon: I'll manage. You don't have to keep an eye on me.
Stefan: I'm not here to keep an eye on you.
Damon: So, why are you here?
Stefan: Why not?
Gilbert Residence


Caroline:  I'm sorry. There. I said it. If you want the ugly-ass necklace, keep it. It's yours.
Bonnie:  Will you hate me if I tell you I threw it away?
Caroline:  You threw it away?
Bonnie: I know it sounds crazy, but the necklace was giving me nightmares. I had to get rid of it.
Caroline: You could have just given it back to me.
Elena:  Why? So you could give it back to Damon?
Caroline: Screw Damon. Are we doing manicures or what? Who has their kit?
Bonnie: Mine's in my bag.
Caroline:  So, Elena...how long do you think this fight with Stefan's gonna last? Is it...like a permanent thing?
Elena: I don't know, Caroline.
Caroline:  Why are you such a little liar, Bonnie?
Bonnie: What?
Elena:  Caroline!


Bonnie: I'm not lying to you, Caroline. I swear.
Elena: It's true. I watched her throw it into a field!
Caroline:  Then explain it.
Bonnie: Emily.
Caroline:  Who's Emily?
Bonnie: The ghost.
Caroline:  Oh, the ghost has a name now?
Elena: Caroline, please.
Bonnie:  I wonder why she won't leave me alone.
Caroline: What is going on? Why am I not a part of this conversation? You guys do this to me all the time.
Elena: That's not true.
Bonnie: Yes it is. I can't talk to you. You don't listen.
Caroline: That's not true.
Bonnie: I'm a witch.
Caroline: And don't we all know it?
Bonnie: See? That's what I'm talking about. I'm trying to tell you something. You don't even hear it.
Caroline: I listen. When do I not listen?
Mystic Grill


Jenna: Jeremy totally ditched me.
Alaric: Where's he go?
Jenna: Home. It's not far. He can walk it.
Alaric: So, are you from here? Are you a townie?
Jenna: I'm a returnee. Left town for a while, now I'm back.
Alaric: Why'd you leave?
Jenna: School. And then there's the real reason. I was wronged...a guy named Logan.
Alaric: What'd he do?
Jenna: Basics...lied, cheated, lured me back in, left me again. Your turn. Any sad relationship stories?
Alaric: The basics...fell in love, married young, my wife died.
Jenna:  Oh. Wow.
Alaric: Yeah, that's always a good conversation stopper.
Jenna: What happened?
Alaric: Well, you, me and the North Carolina police department are all wondering the same thing. It's what's known as a cold case.
Jenna: So, why'd you move here?
Alaric: A change of pace, new scenery. I like it here. It's got a rich history.


Damon: Lucky shot.
Stefan: More like a carefully honed skill over many decades.
Damon: You're beating me.
Stefan: Yeah. It's because I'm better than you.
Damon: I'm onto you. Reverse psychology. It's a little transparent, but I admire the effort.
Stefan: You prefer the brooding forehead?
Damon: Seriously, what game do you think you're playing?
Stefan: That's a funny question considering the fact that I have been asking you that for months. It's frustrating isn't it?
Damon: Touche.
Gilbert Residence


Caroline: Bonnie. Look, it's just not me. I don't believe in the... There is just way too much drama in this room. So, what do you guys wanna do? I have an idea. Why don't we have a seance?
Bonnie:  I don't think that's a good idea.
Caroline: Come on. Let's summon some spirits. This Emily chick has some serious explaining to do.


Bonnie: What are we doing?
Elena: I don't know.
Caroline: Be quiet and concentrate. Close your eyes. Now take a deep breath. Bonnie. Call to her.
Bonnie: Emily, you there?
Caroline: Really? Emily, you there? That's all you got? Come on.
Bonnie: Fine, geez. Emily. I call on you. I know you have a message. I'm here to listen.


Elena: Did that just...
Caroline: Yeah, it just happened.
Bonnie: It's just the air conditioning.
Caroline: Ask her to show you a sign. Ask her. Emily, if you're among us, show us another sign.


Bonnie: See? It's not working.  Get the light. Please, get the light!
Elena: Hold on. I got it.
Bonnie: You guys, the necklace. It's gone.
Mystic Falls High School


Damon: What are we doin' here?
Stefan: Bonding. Catch! Go on. Give it a try.
Damon: Don't forget who taught you how to play this game.


Damon:  That hurt.
Stefan: Downside of my diet--getting hit actually hurts a little bit.
Damon: I'm impressed Stefan. Fun with booze and darts, sentimental with football, and now? Starry night. What do you want, Stefan?
Stefan: It wasn't real, Damon. Our love for Katherine. She compelled us. We didn't have a choice. Took me years to sort that out, to truly understand what she did to us.
Damon: 
Stefan: What do you want with Katherine's crystal?
Damon:  How do you know about that?
Stefan: Come on. You knew Elena would tell me.
Damon: How do you know it was Katherine's? Emily gave it to her on her last night. I was with her, and you weren't.
Stefan: I was the last one to see her, Damon. Now, what do you want with Katherine's crystal?
Damon: She didn't tell you?
Stefan: We had other things on our mind.


Damon: I could rip your heart out and not think twice about it.
Stefan:  I've heard that before.
Damon: I have a bigger surprise, Stefan.  I'm gonna bring her back.
Gilbert Residence


Elena: Okay, fun's over, Caroline. You made a point, and I get it. Now give it back.
Caroline: What? Well, I didn't take it. What? What happened?
Elena: I don't know. Nothing. Jeremy, are you home?


Bonnie: Guys... You guys open the door! Help me!
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! What's going on, Bonnie?
Caroline: Bonnie!


Elena: Try the other door. I'll check the hallway.
Caroline: Bonnie! Bonnie! Unlock the door!
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Open the door!


Elena: What happened? Are you okay?
Bonnie and Emily: I'm fine.
Caroline: Unbelievable. You were totally faking it.
Elena: Caroline, come on.
Caroline: No! You scared the hell out of me.
Elena: Bonnie?
Bonnie and Emily: I'm fine. Everything's fine.
Mystic Falls High School


Stefan: How can you bring Katherine back?
Damon: Before Katherine and the others were killed in the church, you remember what it was like in this town?
Stefan: I remember the fear and the hysteria.
Damon: Townspeople were killing vampires one by one. When they came for Katherine, I went straight to Emily, said,I'll do anything. Name your price. Just protect her. She did.
Stefan: How?
Damon: She did some kind of spell with the crystal. And while the church was burning, and we thought Katherine was burning in it, she wasn't.
Stefan: But I saw her go inside...
Damon: There's a tomb underneath the church. The spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
Stefan: Are you telling me that Katherine's alive?
Damon: If that's what you wanna call it. She's been trapped in a mystical holding cell for the last century and a half, but you're an expert on starving a vampire, so how do you think she's doing, Stefan? Did you know that witches can use celestial events to draw energy into their magic? Me either. But in order to give the crystal its power, Emily used the comet that was passing overhead. And, in order for that crystal to work again...
Stefan: The comet had to return.
Damon: Downside? Long time in between comets. And, a couple of hiccups along the way with the crystal, but the comet passed, and I got the crystal. And then Caroline got the crystal, and now Bonnie has the crystal, and here we are.
Stefan: Why would Emily...? Why would she do this for you?
Damon: Because she knew they were gonna come for her, too, and she made me promise that her lineage would survive.
Stefan: I remember. You saved her children.
Damon: It's the only thing keeping me from ripping that little Bonnie girl's throat out to get my crystal back. Oh well, a deal's a deal. So...you wanna go throw some more?
Gilbert Residence


Caroline: I can't believe I fell for it.
Elena:  Are you okay?
Bonnie and Emily: I must go.
Caroline: She's leaving. I'm leaving.
Elena: You guys can't leave.
Caroline: I can. I've had enough freaky fake witch stuff for one night.
Bonnie and Emily: Thank you for having me. I'll take it from here.
Elena: Where are you going?
Bonnie and Emily: Back to where it all began.
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! Oh My God! Emily!
Bonnie and Emily: I won't let him have it. It must be destroyed.
Elena: Wait!


Caroline: What's happening?
Elena: I don't know. The door, it's not...


Jeremy: What the hell?
Caroline: I'm outta here.


Stefan: What's wrong?
Elena: It's Bonnie.
Stefan: What happened?
Elena: Emily is possessing her. She said something.
Stefan: What did she say?
Elena: She said I won't let him have it. It must be destroyed. And then she just left.
Stefan: Where do you think she went?
Elena: I don't know.  Fell's church, by the old cemetery that's where she took Bonnie in her dreams. We have to help her, Stefan.
Stefan: Just stay there. I'm gonna go find her.
Fell's Church


Damon: Hello Emily. You look different.
Bonnie and Emily: I won't let you do it.
Damon: We had a deal.
Bonnie and Emily: Things are different now. I need to protect my family.
Damon: I protected your family. You owe me.
Bonnie and Emily: I know. I'm sorry.
Damon: You're about to be a lot more than that.


Gilbert Residence


Jenna: You're so wrong. I'm much more pathetic.
Alaric: Oh no no. I've got you beat. I have pathetic down to a science.
Jenna: Oh no. We haven't even covered high school. Braces, A-cup.
Alaric: Glasses, skin condition.


Jenna: You can...You know what? I'm not gonna invite you in.  Jeremy.
Alaric: Well, some other time then. Have a good night, Jenna.


Jenna: So, you found the boxes.
Jeremy: I found this, too.


Jenna: Me and Logan. That's just cruel.
Jeremy: Cruel is dating my history teacher.
Jenna:  I'm not dating him...yet.
Fell's Church


Damon: It hurts. This is why I feed on people.
Bonnie and Emily: Stefan.
Stefan: Hello, Emily.
Bonnie and Emily: These people don't deserve this. They should never have to know such evil.
Stefan: What do you mean evil?
Damon: Emily. I swear to God, I'll make you regret this.
Bonnie and Emily: I won't let you unleash them into this world.
Stefan: Them? What part of the story did you leave out, Damon?
Damon: What does it matter?
Stefan: Emily, tell me what you did.
Bonnie and Emily: To save her, I had to save them.
Stefan: You saved everyone in the church?
Bonnie and Emily: With one, comes all.
Damon: I don't care about them. I just want Katherine.
Stefan: I knew I shouldn't have believed a single word that comes out of your mouth. This isn't about love, is it? This is about revenge.
Damon: The two aren't mutually exclusive.
Stefan: Damon, you can't do this.
Damon: Why not? They killed 27 people, and they called it a war battle. They deserve whatever they get.
Stefan: 27 vampires, Damon. They were vampires. You can't just bring them back.
Damon: This town deserves this.
Stefan: You're blaming innocent people for something that happened 145 years ago.
Damon: There is nothing innocent about these people, and don't think for a second it won't happen again. They already know too much, and they'll burn your little grandwitch right next to us when they find out. Trust me.
Bonnie and Emily: Things are different now.
Damon: Don't do this.
Bonnie and Emily: I can't free them. I won't.  Incendia!


Damon: No! No please.
Elena: Bonnie!
Damon: No!


Stefan: She's alive, but barely. I can save her.


Elena: Her neck, it's healing.
Forbes Residence


Matt: Hey.
Caroline:  What are you doing here?
Matt: Your window was open. I thought you should know.
Caroline: Not funny.
Matt:  Earlier today, I lied.
Caroline: About?
Matt: About being in bed with you. We cuddled and it creeped me out.
Caroline: It creeped you out? I mean, did you just come over here to insult me or what? Because it's been a really long night--
Matt: --It's just that...I don't like you. I never have. But...it was nice.
Caroline:  What?
Matt: Being in bed with you, it felt nice. And so, I was thinking about it, and I thought that I should tell you I stayed because you were all sad and alone and I felt bad for you.
Caroline: Well, thank you, 'cause I love being a charity case. You can leave now.
Matt:  No, because I know! With Vicki gone, and my mom off with Pete whoever, it's just me, so...I know.
Woods


Damon: Katherine never compelled me. I knew everything. Every step of the way. It was real for me. I'll leave now.


Bonnie: I don't understand, Elena, what happened to me? He attacked me, and his face was like...
Elena: How do you feel? Are you okay?
Bonnie: I'm fine. It's just this blood. I don't...


Stefan: I'm not gonna hurt you.
Bonnie: What's going on, Elena?
Elena: I'll explain everything, Bonnie. Okay? Let's just get out of here. Bonnie. Bonnie, look at me. Trust me. He's not going to hurt you. Come on. Come on.


Elena: Is she in danger of becoming...?
Stefan: No, she has to die with my blood in her system. So, keep an eye on her tonight and make sure that nothing happens, and once it leaves her system, she'll be fine.
Elena: I'm gonna tell her the truth.
Stefan: You sure?
Elena: I can trust her. I need someone to know, someone to talk to. I can't live in secret.
Stefan: You shouldn't have to.
Elena: You saved her life. I'm sorry, Stefan. I thought that I couldn't be with you, but I can. You don't have to push me away. I can do this. 
Stefan:  I can't. I have to leave, Elena. Too many people have died. Too much has happened.
Elena: What? No! I know you think you're protecting me, but...
Stefan: I have to. Coming home was...it was a mistake. I can't be a part of your life anymore.
Elena: Don't go Stefan. Please...You don't have to. This is your home. Please, don't go.


Stefan: Good-bye, Elena.
Elena: You're just gonna walk away? Don't walk away, Stefan! Stefan! 


Gilbert Residence


Logan:  Hello, Jenna.
Jenna:  Logan!
Logan: Aren't you gonna invite me in?

Gilbert Residence


Jenna: Why are you here, Logan?
Logan: I missed you. I was out of town. I...
Jenna: Yeah, I got that email.
Logan:  You got an email?
Jenna: You didn't send an email?
Logan: I can explain. Just invite me in and I'll tell you everything.
Jenna: I'm not gonna invite you in. Forget it.
Logan: Come on, Jenna. It's me.
Jenna: The answer's no.
Logan: I know you. You're always one step from a maybe, a tiny nudge to yes.
Jenna:  You just pointed out that I have no self-control. Clever strategy!


Logan: Evening.


Daphne:  Hey, you're that guy from the news, Logan Fell. I watch you every night. Well, I used to, I mean, you've been missing from my TV.
Logan: I took some time off.
Daphne: I noticed. I'm Daphne.


Logan: Hey you know something, Daphne?
Daphne: No, what?






Jeremy: I live in fear. It consumes me. In the early evening when I see the sun begin to fade, the fear comes, because I know that the night brings death.


Elena: Jeremy's got his sketch pad out.
Jenna: You're kidding?
Elena: Nope. But don't say a word. The minute we encourage him, he'll put it away.
Jenna: Psychology major. Check that!


Jenna: You and Stefan? Update?
Elena:  He knows how I feel and where I stand and I know where he stands but it doesn't matter. He's leaving, moving away.
Jenna: Where is he going?
Elena: I've stopped asking questions. The answers get scary.


Jenna: Yours leaves, mine returns.
Elena: Logan?
Jenna: He's back.   I didn't let him pass the front door.
Elena: I hope you slammed it in his face.
Jenna: Ah, medium slam.
Elena: Three-strike rule, Jenna. You're not even allowed to watch the news.
Jenna: Exactly. No more Logan Scum Fell.

Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: So any idea of where you'll go?
Damon: I don't know. London, maybe. See some friends.
Stefan: You don't have any friends, Damon.
Damon: You're right, Stefan. I only have you.  So, where are we goin'?
Stefan: We are not going anywhere. I'm gonna live my life as far away from you as possible.
Damon:  But we're a team! We could travel the world together. We could try out for The Amazing Race.
Stefan: Mmmm, that's funny. Seriously, where are you going? Because we are not staying in this town.


Sheriff Forbes: I'm here to see Damon.
Stefan: Uh, sure. Ok.


Damon: Sheriff. What a surprise.
Sheriff Forbes: Sorry to bother you, but we need to talk.
Damon: Come in.


Damon: Um, I hope you understand the secrecy. Stefan doesn't know about this yet and I'd like to keep it that way.
Sheriff Forbes: Of course, kids are too young to be brought into this.
Damon: So, what do you need?
Sheriff Forbes: There's been another attack. A female victim, her throat torn out, completely drained of blood. It fits the pattern.
Damon: I'm sorry. I don't understand. I thought we solved that problem when I ...staked the blond one.
Sheriff Forbes: I'm thinking she must have turned someone. Or multiple someones. I don't know.


Sheriff Forbes: The story for the town is another animal attack but I'm not sure how long we can keep lying to them. The council is in an uproar. We thought we were past this.
Damon: So, uh, what do we do?
Sheriff Forbes: You're the only one who's ever taken on a vampire. We were hoping you could tell us.
Mystic Falls High School


Matt: And then the ballet dancer and the Krumper did the salsa.
Caroline: Well, I was awake for that part.
Matt: Well, I don't know when you fell asleep. Umm, did you see the Celine Dion waltz about cancer?
Caroline: Those always make me cry!
Matt: Yeah, and then the loud judge kept screaming and I couldn't take it, so I turned it off.


Caroline: I sat through Family Guy.  So, you owe me.


Elena: Did I miss something?
Bonnie: They've been hanging out.
Elena: Kind of weird, don't you think?


Bonnie: She needs someone nice like him, as opposed to a homicidal vampire like Damon.
Elena: Yeah, how are you doing with all that?
Bonnie: I'm freaked out. Damon attacked me. I could be dead right now. But I'm also grateful.
Elena: Hmm?
Bonnie: To Stefan. He saved my life and...Have you seen him?


Elena:  Not since he told me he was leaving. For all I know, he's already gone.
Bonnie: He wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
Elena:  Yes, he would. He thinks he's protecting me. Clean break and all that.
Bonnie: So, what are you gonna do?
Elena: What am I supposed to do? I've already begged him not to go. If I ask again, I'm being selfish. It is what it is.


Bonnie: Maybe it's for the best.


Elena: What? Why?
Bonnie: I mean, what kind of future could you have had with him, even if he stayed?


Elena: Did you just...?
Bonnie: No, I swear.


Elena: Oh, God.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Thank you for stopping by.
Sheriff Forbes: Let me know what you come up with.


Damon: Absolutely.


Stefan: What is wrong with you? You killed somebody?
Damon: Get off of me.   C...There's another vampire in town.
Stefan: That's impossible.
Damon: Obviously not.


Stefan: Then, who could it be?
Damon: Ah, what do we care? We're leaving anyway, right?
Stefan: No, I can't leave now and you know that.  How are we supposed to find this person?
Damon: Let the adults handle this, Stefan.


Mystic Falls High School


Elena: See you later, ok?
Girl: Bye.
Elena: Bye.


Stefan: Hi.  We need to talk.




Tyler: So, what's up with you and Forbes?
Matt: Nothing's up.
Tyler: I saw you two in the hall today. Don't even try to deny it, bro. You're tapping that.
Matt: No, it's not like that.
Tyler: Never is. Until you become we people.


Matt: We people?
Tyler: Yeah, we can't make it to the party; we'll never miss a game; we don't like the color red
Matt: We hung out, like, twice.


Tyler: Like I said, we.


Elena: So, you have no idea who it could be?
Stefan: None. But it must be somebody new because leaving a body like that, they're either sloppy or they're trying to send a message.
Elena: And you're sure it's not Damon?
Stefan: Well, I'm never sure about Damon, but he's been trying to keep a low profile lately, so it's just doesn't make any sense to me.
Elena: So what are you gonna do?
Stefan: Damon is tracking them right now.  Look, I promised you the truth so I wanted to tell you. I want you to be careful.


Elena: When I saw you, I...thought you were coming to say goodbye.
Stefan: Not yet.
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: Hey, what do you think?
Jenna:  Creepy.
Jeremy: I found this old journal in dad's stuff, Johnathan Gilbert from the 1800s. He's kind of a freak show.  He wrote about demons and all of these people getting slaughter and...
Jenna: Yeah, he was a writer...short stories, horror stuff.
Jeremy: Oh, he wrote fiction? Figured he was just a lunatic or a drunk.


Jenna: Well, he was a Gilbert, probably a little bit of both.


Warehouse


Caroline: So what do I do now?
Damon: Just wait. I'll be there in minute.
Caroline: Can you hurry? I have things to do.


Damon: You can give me that.


Caroline: So, why did you need me to do this?
Damon: Because I interfere with the signal.
Caroline: Can I go now? This has blown, like, half of my day.
Damon: You do that.  Get in your car. Go home. Forget I asked you to do this.
Caroline:  Ok. Bye now.
Damon: Bye.


Logan: I have tons of these wood bullets, so nothing funky.


Damon: You don't wanna do this, trust me.


Logan: That's what you get.
Damon: For what?
Logan:  You made me like this.
Damon: I killed you. I didn't turn you.


Logan: See I know what you and your brother are. I've been watching the two of you. I knew you'd show up here and I'm glad you did, because I have some questions.
Damon:  Me first. Who turned you?
Logan:  How should I know? Last thing I remember is, I'm about to stake your brother and then you grabbed me. That's it! Until I wake up in the ground behind a used car dealership on highway 4. Somebody buried me.
Damon: It happens.  Ow.
Logan: You bit me.
Damon:  Damn it.
Logan: It had to be you.
Damon: You have to have vampire blood in your system when you die. I didn't do that. Some other vampire found you, gave you their blood.


Logan: Who?
Damon: That's what I wanna know.
Logan: Dude, it's not like the welcome wagon was waiting with a bundt cake and a handbook. It's been a learn as you go process. You know, one minute, I'm a small town on the rise news guy and next thing I know, I can't get into my house, because my foot won't go through the door.
Damon:  You have to be invited in.
Logan: I know. I live alone.
Damon: Ah,  that sucks.
Logan: So now, I am at the Ramada, watching pay per view all day, eating everything in sight, including housekeeping.
Damon: It could be worse.
Logan: All I can think about is blood and killing people. I can't stop killing people. I keep killing  and I like it. I'm conflicted.
Damon: Welcome to the club.


Damon: Wait a minute. Cops only found one body.
Logan: I left one. I was tired. But I've been hiding the rest of bodies. They're right back there.


Damon: You're kidding.
Logan: They're just piling up!
Mystic Falls High School


Mayor Lockwood: So what do we know?
Sheriff Forbes: Nothing new to report yet.  My highly reliable deputies are all on alert, but if you feel the need to be more proactive, by all means, grab a stake and have at it.
Mayor Lockwood:  What extra precautions can we take?
Sheriff Forbes: For right now, there is nowhere safer than a crowded public place, and for once, Mayor, we actually know where our kids are.


Tyler: What do you want?
Jeremy: Hey. Uh, I'm just surprised to see you here.  Art usually implies culture and culture implies, well, not you.
Tyler: Go to hell.




Elena: Still wanna be an astronaut?
Matt: I can't believe you remember that.
Elena: I can remember the tinfoil that you wore on your head.
Matt: I was eight.
Elena: How are you doing?
Matt: I've had it easier. You? I heard some things.  So it's true that you and Stefan...
Elena: Yeah, it is.


Elena: What about you, Matt Donovan? I heard about Caroline.
Matt: Aw, man, not you too.
Elena: Hey.
Matt: We're friends.  It's not a big deal.
Elena: No?
Matt: No.


Warehouse
Logan: Why am I so overly emotional? All I can think about is my ex-girlfriend. I wanna be with her and bite her and stuff.
Damon: Well, you probably love her. Anything you felt before will be magnified now. You're gonna have to learn how to control that.
Logan: What about walking in the sun? I'm a morning person. You can walk in the sun which, by the way, is pretty cool.  The council will never suspect you. That's not in the journals.
Damon: The journals?
Logan: Yeah, the founding fathers, they passed down journals to their kids. Come on man, you gotta tell me. How can you walk around in the sun?
Damon: Who turned you?
Logan: How do you walk in the sun?
Damon: Who turned you?
Logan: You know, I've been really nice so far but I will kill you.


Damon: Then you'll never know.  You're not answering my question.
Logan: You first!
Damon: It seems we're at a bit of an impasse then, doesn't it?
Logan: I have things to do, people to kill. Guess I'll be needing a little head start.


Mystic Falls High School


Elena: I'm guessing you're not here to plan the path for your future.  You're looking out for me.
Stefan: Hope that's ok.


Stefan: You know I wanted to be a doctor before everything happened, but, uh, then I couldn't, 'cause...
Elena: The blood.
Stefan: Yeah. I've dabbled in a bunch of different things, though.
Elena: Didn't love anything enough to stick to it?


Stefan: No, I...I loved it all. I just...I had to move on before anybody could notice that I wasn't getting any older.
Elena: How long before that would happen?
Stefan: Few years, usually. Sometimes shorter.
Elena:  And you always left?
Stefan: I didn't have a choice.


Stefan:  So, what about...what about you? What are your, uh, plans for the future?
Elena:  I don't wanna talk about my future, Stefan. Because everything you're saying is making it perfectly clear that you're not gonna be in.
Stefan: Elena, it's not that I don't wanna be in it.
Elena: You can't, I get it. I heard you the first time and the second time, and I appreciate you looking out for me but, please, if you're gonna leave, then just go.


Jenna: Hide me.
Elena: What's going on?
Jenna: The scum Fell has landed.
Elena: Logan's here.
Stefan:  Wait, Logan Fell?


Elena: Stefan, what's going on?


Logan: Jenna, are you dodging me?
Jenna: It's a form of self-preservation.
Stefan: Um, Elena, why don't you and Jenna go somewhere else?


Elena: Let's go.


Stefan: What are you doing here?
Logan: You know, your brother asked me the same thing. In fact, why don't we just skip past all that who turned me stuff and get the answer that I want? How can I turn into a day walker?
Stefan: Damon and I are the only two that I know of.
Logan: But you're both very cagey on the how, which tells me that there is a way. You know, in case you hadn't noticed, I'm quite the celebrity in this town. It would be very, very easy for me to expose you.
Stefan: You wanna know how you can walk around in the sun?
Logan: I do.
Stefan: You can't. Don't ever threaten me again.




Elena: When Logan came to the house, what did he say?
Jenna: Fake flattery. Stupid, dimpled grin. Puppy dog eyes.
Elena: I'm serious, Jenna. How did he act? What did he say?
Jenna: He was the usual Logan, was charming, a little more manic than usual. He kept trying to convince me to let him in.  What?
Elena: Ok, listen to me very carefully. Do not, under any circumstances, talk to him again. I'm serious, Jenna, like ever!


Alaric: Hey Elena. Jenna
Elena: Hi Mr. Saltzman.
Alaric:  Yeah, I was hoping to see you tonight.
Jenna: Career night is the new bowling.


Elena: Ok, um, excuse me.




Damon: Logan Fell is a vampire and when I find him again, I'm gonna destroy him limb by limb.


Stefan:  What happened? Are you ok?


Damon: No, I'm not ok. I was ambushed. I was shot.  Now, I'm vengeful. Just got to find him.
Stefan: Well, there's no need. He's here at the school.
Damon: You're kidding me. Why the hell is he there?
Stefan: He's working the crowd.
Damon: Well, I'll be right there.


Elena:  So. Anything you'd like to share?


Sheriff Forbes: What are you doing?
Caroline: Following my future.  There it is.
Sheriff Forbes: Broadcast journalism?
Caroline: Yes. Broadcast journalism.  Why are you looking at me like that?
Sheriff Forbes: You don't even read the paper.


Logan: Liz.
Sheriff Forbes:  Logan.


Logan: What are you gonna do stake me? Bury me in another shallow grave? What would the email say this time?
Sheriff Forbes: I didn't have a choice.
Logan:  You bitch! I died for you, for this town. You've known me since I was six and you swept me under the rug like dirt.
Sheriff Forbes: You knew what you were getting into.
Logan: I was one of you.
Sheriff Forbes: And now you're one of them.


Logan: Watch your back, Sheriff.


Sheriff Forbes: Get a backup team to the school immediately. Keep it within the circle. It's a V5.




Jeremy: I didn't know you drew.
Tyler: It's an elective.
Jeremy: Because it's good stuff. You like graphics? Cause that's, uh, that's kind of my thing.
Tyler:  Woah, whoa, what are you doing?
Jeremy:  Well, it's just something else we have in common.
Tyler: What's the other thing? Vicki? Let's hang out because we did the same chick? Go be friends with one of the many other guys that she screwed, there is no shortage of them.


Alaric:  Alright, work it out, tough guy.
Mayor Lockwood: You two, follow me.


Alaric: Excuse me, Mayor.  Where are you taking them?
Mayor Lockwood: I'm gonna talk to them. All fights should end in handshakes, don't you think?  Come on.


Caroline: Bonnie, where are you? I'm ready to go. I'll be outside.


Logan: Hey, damsel in distress, need a ride?
Caroline: 
Logan: I used to baby sit you, Caroline Forbes. Don't mock me.
Caroline: Well, I was supposed to go home with Bonnie, but I can't find her.
Logan: It's not a problem, really. It's on my way.
Caroline: Okay.


Caroline: You know, this is fate.
Logan: And why is that?
Caroline: Because I'm interested in broadcast journalism. So can I ask you a couple questions?
Logan: Anything you want. But first, buckle up.
Caroline: Ok.




Matt: Hey.
Elena:  Hey, have you seen Logan Fell, the news guy?
Matt: Yeah. He just gave Caroline a ride home.


Stefan: Stay here.




Mayor Lockwood: Ok, let's get this out of your system. Go ahead. Fight.
Jeremy: You want us to what?
Tyler: I'm not gonna fight him, dad.
Jeremy: I don't think so, sir.


Mayor Lockwood: You don't fight in there like pansies. You take it outside, fight your battles like men, and move on. Best lesson my dad taught me. So let's settle it. Fight.


Tyler: Come on, dad.
Jeremy: That's not gonna happen.
Mayor Lockwood: I said fight!


Alaric: Whoa. What's going on out here?
Mayor Lockwood: Just letting these two kids work it out. We're good here. Go back inside.
Alaric: I don't wanna go back inside. What I want is an answer to my question. What's going on out here?
Mayor Lockwood: Who do you think you're talking to? Do I look like a student?
Alaric: No. You look like a full grown alpha male douchebag.


Mayor Lockwood: You don't talk to me like that. I can have your job like this. 
Alaric: Ah, you do that. Then it will be you and me in this parking lot, working things out. You cool with that?
Mayor Lockwood: You just marked yourself.
Alaric: Ok.


Alaric:  You all right?


Mystic Falls


Sheriff Forbes: Where are you?
Logan: Your daughter has expressed an interest in journalism. I think it's important to foster young minds.
Sheriff Forbes: What do you want?
Logan: The satisfaction of turning your daughter into a vampire.


Damon: Payback's a bitch, isn't it?  Get her out of here.


Sheriff Forbes : Logan, what happened?! Logan?


Damon : Sheriff, yeah, it's Damon.
Sheriff Forbes : Where is Caroline?


Damon : She's ok. I'm on Elm Street.


Damon: Gonna try this one more time.  Who turned you?
Logan: I told you I don't know.
Damon:  Is that your final answer?
Logan: How can you side with them?
Damon: I don't side with anyone. You pissed me off. I want you dead. Who turned you?
Logan: I don't know!
Damon: Oh, well. You're screwed.


Logan: Wait, wait! I do know.
Damon: You're lying.
Logan: You think you're the only one who wants to get in that tomb underneath the old church?
Damon: If you're lying to me, I will end you.
Logan: I am not lying. There is another way to break the spell. We can help you. Meet me at the old church.


Damon: Take me down. Make it look real. Make it look real!


Sheriff Forbes: Where is she?
Damon: She's ok. My brother's taken her home. I'm sorry, Sheriff. I just wasn't strong enough.
Mystic Falls High School


Elena: Caroline?


Stefan: Shes ok. I took her home. She was shaken up. But all she knows is Logan attacked her. Nothing else.
Elena: Where's Logan?
Stefan: Damon's dealing with him.
Elena: As in...?


Stefan: You saw what happened tonight, right?  I mean, you understand why we can't be together? You see it?
Elena: Yeah, I'm starting to see a lot of things, Stefan. Come on. I'll, uh, I'll give you a ride.
Stefan: Uh, I can get home.
Elena: I know.
Stefan: All right. That'd be nice.




Jeremy: Hey.
Tyler: What do you want?


Jeremy: I don't know. I, uh, I thought that was weird with your dad, what he did. Is he like that all the time? Is that...Is that what you gotta go through? Man, I...I get it. I get it.  What's your problem?
Tyler: Look, I don't need your pity.
Jeremy: Seriously, you don't have to be like this. You don't.
Tyler: Just go.


Jeremy: What is your problem, man?
Tyler: I don't know, ok? I don't know.


Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: What I said before about you leaving. It was harsh.
Stefan: No, no. You had every right.
Elena: You asked me what I wanted my future to be. I wanted to be a writer. My mom sort of push me into that direction from the time I was able to read. She supported me, encouraged me, bought me my first journal, and then she died. And I can't see myself being a writer anymore. That was something that we shared. I know that you think you put all of this bad stuff into my life, but my life already had it. I was buried in it.
Stefan: This is different.
Elena: It doesn't make it any less painful.
Stefan: I know that it's...that's it's hard to understand, but I'm doing this for you.


Elena: No.


Elena: You don't get to make that decision for me. If you walk away, it's for you, because I know what I want. Stefan, I love you.


Elena: Don't.
Stefan: Elena, I can't...
Elena: Yes, you can.  Don't hide from me.


Warehouse


Logan: Who are you?
Alaric: A friend of Jenna's.
Logan: Jenna sent you?
Alaric: No, I came on my own.
Logan: Ah, I get it. Well, buddy, I know you think this makes you brave. But actually it makes you pretty stupid.
Alaric: Either way, here I am.
Logan: What do you want?
Alaric: Jenna is a good person. She deserves the best. I'm here to make sure she gets it.
Logan: Was that supposed to be a threat? Couldn't you throw a punch? Maybe provoke me a little?
Alaric: I'm not a violent guy by design.
Logan: Well, you're not a very smart one, either.
Alaric: How's that?


Logan: 'Cause you have no idea who you're talking to.


Mystic Falls High School


Tyler: I need a ride
Matt: Sure.


Matt: Look, I like Caroline.  She's got this thing....this way about her....and I like her ok? And I'm not gonna defend it or apologize about.
Tyler: Ok.
Matt: So stop your little bromance bitch act.
Tyler:  Ok.

Sheriff Forbes: Yeah, I'll be right there.


Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: I've never been in your room before.
Stefan: Hm, well, it hasn't changed much over the years.
Elena: Do you leave everything here when you come and go?
Stefan: It's the only place that...that has remained constant. This room holds every memory that I've ever thought was important enough to hold on to.


Elena: A lot of memories.


Stefan: Yep. Are you thirsty or anything?
Elena: A little. You? Uh...
Stefan: I'm fine. Let me get you something to drink, ok?
Elena: Ok.


Old Church


Damon: Hello.


Sheriff Forbes: I just wanted to say thank you. I don't know how you did it.
Damon: Um, not following.
Sheriff Forbes: We found Logan's body up by the old Fell warehouse. He has been disposed of. He was hoarding victims, innocent victims.
Damon: What?
Sheriff Forbes: This town owes you so much. So do I.

Elena: Ah!
Damon: How ya doing in there?
Elena: Damon?
Damon: You look stuck.
Elena: It's my seat belt. I can't get it.
Damon: Shh Shh Shh. Let me get you out of there. I want you to put your hands on the roof. Just like that. You ready? 1, 2, 3.  Are you okay? Can you stand? Is anything broken?
Elena: Uh-uh.


Damon: Whoa, you're fading fast, Elena. Elena, look at me.  Focus. Look at me. Okay.
Elena: I look like her...
Damon: What?


Damon: Upsy-daisy.


Alaric's Apartment
Alaric : I found one. After years of research and study, there it was right in front of me. I was terrified. As I stared it in the eyes, I drove a stake through its heart. I was right about Mystic Falls. There is evil here. I can sense it. Feel it. It's everywhere.


Flashback


Isobel:  Ohhh. It's not even seven yet.
Alaric: Which means you shouldn't be awake for at least six hours.
Isobel:  I hate morning people.
Alaric: I'm going to be home late.
Isobel: I love you.
Alaric: I love you too.
Somewhere In Georgia


Damon: Morning.
Elena: Where are we?
Damon: Georgia.
Elena: Georgia? No, no. No, we're not. Seriously, Damon. Where are we?
Damon: Seriously, we're...we're in Georgia. How ya feeling?
Elena: I...I...
Damon: There's no broken bones. I checked.
Elena: But my car...there was a man...I hit a man. But then he got up, and...who was that?
Damon: That's what I would like to know.
Elena: Where is my phone? OK. We really need to go back. Nobody knows where I am. Pull over. I mean it, Damon. Pull over! Stop the car!
Damon: Oh you were so much more fun when you were asleep.


Damon:  Hey.
Elena:  I'm fine. We have to go back.
Damon: Oh come on. Look. We've already come this far...
Elena: Why are you doing this? I can't be in Georgia. I wrecked my car. I have to go home. This is kidnapping.
Damon: That's a little melodramatic, don't you think?
Elena: You're not funny. You can't do this. I'm not going to Georgia.
Damon: Well, you're IN Georgia. Without your magical little necklace, I might add. I can very easily make you...agreeable.
Elena: What are you trying to prove?


Elena: That's my phone.
Damon: Mmm. It's your boyfriend. I'll take it.  Elena's phone...!
Stefan: Where is she? Why do you have her phone? Is she okay?
Damon: Elena? She's right here. And, yes, she's fine.
Stefan: Where are you? Let me speak to her.
Damon: He wants to talk to you.
Elena:  Uh-uh.
Damon: Yeah. I don't...I don't really think she wants to talk to you right now.
Stefan: Damon, I swear to God, if you touch her...
Damon:  You have a good day. Mm-hmm. Bye-now.
Stefan: Argh!
Elena : Look, no one knows where I am. Can we please just go back?
Damon: We're almost there.
Elena: Where is there?!
Damon: A little place right outside of Atlanta. Oh, come on, Elena. You don't wanna go back right now. Do you? What's the rush? Time-out. Trust me. Your problems are still going to be there when you get home. Look. Step away from your life for five minutes. Five minutes!
Elena: Am I gonna be safe with you?
Damon: Yes.
Elena: You promise not to do that mind control thing with me?
Damon: Yes.
Elena: Can I trust you?
Damon: Get in the car. Come on.
Mystic Falls High School


Jeremy: Hey, Mr. Saltzman!
Alaric: Hey, Jeremy. I, uh...can't find my ring. I took it off for the gym, and thought I put it...there it is! Losing family heirlooms...bad. How's your extra credit coming? You pick a topic yet?
Jeremy: Mystic Falls, the Civil War era.
Alaric: What's the angle?
Jeremy: My family. I found a journal of an ancestor who lived in the 1800s. And the Gilberts were one of the original Founding Families of Mystic Falls. So...
Alaric: That sounds good.


Stefan: Bonnie.
Bonnie: Stefan...
Stefan: Hey.
Bonnie: Hi.
Stefan: I haven't seen you lately. How are you doing with everything?
Bonnie: I'm fine. It's all fine.
Stefan: Good. Yeah.
Bonnie: Are you back in school?
Stefan: No. Actually I came here to find you. I was hoping you could help me with something. A spell.
Bonnie: Stefan, look, I know Elena's okay with all of this, and I appreciate what you did to help me. But I'm not really ready to dive into it with you just yet.
Stefan: I understand that. But I need your help. It's Elena. She's with Damon. I have Elena's necklace. I was just hoping you could use this to make some sort of a connection. I just need to know that she's okay.
Bonnie: How do you know I can do this?
Stefan: Because I've known a few witches over the years. I've seen what they can do.
Bonnie: I'm still new at it.
Stefan: It's okay. Give it a shot.
Bonnie: Okay. All right.


Bonnie: There's nothing. Nothing's happening. Usually there's an image or...tell me if anyone's looking.
Stefan: Okay.


Stefan: What is it?
Bonnie: Something's wrong.
Stefan: With Elena?
Bonnie: With me. There's something wrong with me. 
Georgia


Elena: So, where's my car?
Damon: I pulled it off to the side of the road. I don't think anyone will bother it.
Elena: What about that man in the road? Was he a...?
Damon: From what I could tell, yeah...
Elena: You didn't know him?
Damon: If I've never met him, I wouldn't know him. I mean, it's not like we all hang out together at the Vamp Bar and Grill.
Bree's Bar


Elena: Where are we? You brought me to a bar? Damon, I'm not old enough. They're not going to let me in.
Damon: Sure they will.


Bree: No. No, it can't be. Damon. My honey pie.


Bree: 
Elena: I'm not roped in. Actually, I'm dating his...
Bree: Honey, if you're not roped, you're whipped. Either way, just enjoy the ride. 
Elena: Okay. So, how did you two meet?
Bree: College.
Elena : You went to college?
Damon:  I've been on a college campus, yes.
Bree: About twenty years ago, when I was a sweet, young freshman, I met this beautiful man, and I fell in love. And then he told me about his little secret, made me love him more. Because, you see, I had a little secret of my own that I was dying to share with somebody.
Damon : She's a witch.
Bree: Changed my world, you know.
Damon:  I rocked your world.
Bree: He is good in the sack, isn't he? But mostly he's just a Walk-Away Joe.  So, what is it that you want?
Mystic Falls Library


Anna: Oh my god. I am so sorry. There was this one book wedged between the other, and so I pulled and then kaplunk, kaboom.  Are you ok?
Jeremy: Yeah, I'm fine.


Anna:  Ahh! I'm Anna.
Jeremy:  I'm Jeremy.
Gram's Residence


Bonnie: Thank God you're back.
Grams: And hello to you, too. What's the matter?
Bonnie: My powers are gone, Grams. I can't do anything, even when I concentrate. And there's nothing in in any of these books that can tell me how to get them back.
Grams: Hang on, now. Just calm down. Tell me what happened.
Bonnie: I can't.
Grams: We keeping secrets now?
Bonnie: I have to. I'm sorry. I promised. Please, help me.
Grams: Well, first of all, there's nothing in any of these that's gonna help you. If you're blocked, it's in here.  You gotta clear it out, then you're back in business.
Bonnie: Clear what out?
Grams: Whatever's got you so scared.
Bree's Bar


Elena: Hi, Jenna. I'm so sorry.
Jenna: Where are you? Why didn't you call?
Elena: I was so tired last night. I fell asleep at Bonnie's. And then this morning, I just wanted to get to school.
Jenna: Are you okay?
Elena: You know, Stefan and stuff.


Damon:  Come on, there's gotta be another way.
Bree: After all these years, it's still only Katherine. How do you even know she's still alive?
Damon: Well, you help me get into that tomb, and we'll find out.
Bree: I already did. Twenty years ago. Remember? Three easy steps: Comet. Crystal. Spell.
Damon: There's a little problem with number two. I don't have the crystal.
Bree: That's it, Damon. There is no other way. It's Emily's spell.
Damon: What about a new spell with a new crystal that overrides Emily's spell?
Bree: It doesn't work that way, baby. Emily's spell is absolute. You can't get into that tomb.
Fell's Church Ruins


Bonnie:  Hello? Anybody here?! Aah!


Bree's Bar


Stefan: Elena, is that you?
Elena: I'm here.
Stefan: Where are you?
Elena: You lied.
Stefan: Not until I explain, please.
Elena: So, you didn't lie?
Stefan: Just tell me where you are, so that I can come get you.
Elena: How am I connected to Katherine, Stefan?
Stefan: I honestly don't know.
Elena: And I'm supposed to believe that?
Stefan: It's the truth. I-- Listen...


Damon: You okay?
Elena: Don't pretend to care. I know you're gloating inside.


Bree: Hey, it's Bree. You'll never gonna guess who walked into my bar.
Fell's Church Ruins


Bonnie: Ow. Hello?! Anybody?! Ahh!


Gram's Residence


Stefan: Hi.
Grams: Can I help you?
Stefan: I'm Stefan.  I'm a friend of Bonnie's. Her dad told me that she might be here.
Grams: She was. Not anymore.
Stefan: Do you know where she went?
Grams: No. But you do.
Stefan: I'm sorry?
Grams: I told her to face down her fear. And I'm sensing now that you know exactly why she was scared. You know what I am. And yet you offered me your hand, which means you wanted me to see that I can trust you.
Stefan: Can you?
Grams: I trust you'll keep her safe. You'd better be on your way, then. I'm not going to invite you in. I'm sure you understand why.
Mystic Falls Library
Anna:  This aisle is local and state history. And Civil War is one over. What do you need?
Jeremy: Local. 1860s. Do you work here?
Anna: Nope. You want reference. This way. Um, home-schooled. I study here for a mock-school environment. Ah, here we go. Original settlers, town archives, Founders' stuff. It's all here. So, what's your topic?
Jeremy: The town's fear and hysteria surrounding the war and how it influenced certain writers of the time.
Anna: You might want to focus that.
Jeremy: The origin of local folklore and myths.
Anna:  You mean, the vampires?
Bree's Bar


Elena: Let's just say that I'm descended from Katherine...does that make me part vampire?
Damon: Vampires can't procreate.  No, if you were related, it would mean Katherine had a child before she was turned.
Elena: Did Stefan think that he could use me to replace her?
Damon: Kinda creepy if you ask me.  Come on, what? You don't like pickles? What's wrong with you?
Elena: How can you even eat? If technically you're supposed to be...
Damon:  It's not such a bad word. As long as I keep a healthy diet of blood in my system, my body functions pretty normally.
Elena:  This nice act. Is any of it real?


Bree: Here you go. 
Damon: Thank you.
Elena: I'll have one too.
Damon:  Hmm?
Elena: Time out, remember? For five minutes? Yeah, well that five minutes is going to need a beer.
Bree: 
Mystic Falls Library
Jeremy: You're kidding me, right? There's no such thing as vampires.
Anna: Well, there's not a lot of documentation, but the stories have been told since the Civil War. My granddad used to tell me all these creepy stories when I was little. And he said that his granddad told them to him.
Jeremy: Yeah, that would be folklore. Vampires are a metaphor for the demons of the day!
Anna: Which are?
Jeremy: The union soldiers! I've read the stories myself. They talk about the enemy, the demons that attack at night.
Anna: That sounds like vampires to me.
Jeremy: Allegorical vampires. Which is what it is. Creative expression during a very volatile time. I mean, a country at war doesn't want realism. They want fantasy. Thus, vampire fiction.
Anna: Man, you're smart. I gotta give it to you; when I first saw you, I missed it.
Jeremy: Yeah. I've had a rough go of it lately, but I'm just now getting back to my old self.
Anna: Well, good luck on your paper. I gotta get home.  You know, my great grandfather actually showed me a journal once of an ancestor, and he had written all of this creepy stuff about vampires. It was actually really believable.
Jeremy: Wait. A journal?
Anna: Yeah? Why?
Jeremy: Are you sure you have to go?
Fell's Church Ruins


Bonnie: Come on, phone! Great! Great.


Stefan: Bonnie!
Bonnie:  Get away from me!
Stefan: It's me! It's Stefan.
Bonnie: Stefan?  The ground gave way, and I fell...
Stefan: It's okay. It's okay. Calm down. Come on, let's get you out of here.
Bonnie: How?
Stefan: Just close your eyes. Trust me.


Stefan: You can open your eyes now.
Bonnie:  Whoa.
Stefan: I didn't want to scare you.
Bonnie: How did you know where I was?
Stefan: Well, your grandmother told me what you were doing. I guessed the where.
Bonnie: I heard them...down there...behind the door.  Are they in pain?
Stefan: In the beginning...yes. But not anymore. They've starved to the point of desiccation.
Bonnie: But if they have blood...
Stefan: That's not going to happen, Bonnie. They can't get out. Emily saw to that when she had you destroy the crystal. You're safe.
Bree's Bar


Bree: Ready....Go!


Elena: That's three!  Aw, do you need a bib?
Damon: Sorry I can't unhinge my jaw like a snake to consume alcohol.
Elena: Whatever. All right. Who's next? Another round, Bree.
Woman: Honey, you should be on the floor!
Elena: 
Bree: All right. Here you go. 


Mystic Grill


Jeremy: So, you have no idea where the journal is?
Anna: Nope. Gramps died. And all the kids split his stuff. I can ask.
Jeremy: I just find it weird that our ancestors kept the same kind of journal. It's crazy.
Anna: Maybe it's based in some partial reality.
Jeremy: No. It's gotta be metaphorical. My ancestor wrote short stories.
Anna: So, that's why you're hung up on the fiction of it all.
Jeremy: No, I'm hung up on the fiction of it all because I've seen The Lost Boys and Near Dark, like, fifty times.
Anna: Are those movies? Hey, I've never seen them. Maybe we can have a Fright Night and rent a whole bunch of vampire movies.
Jeremy: Uh, yeah, sure.
Anna: Why does that sound like a no way in hell? Sorry, I'm blunt.
Jeremy: No, it's--I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I just recently got out of something. It's a little too soon, you know?
Anna: Oh please, sure. No worries. I meant as friends. Yeah. Look, I really gotta go. Nice meeting you, Jeremy.
Bree's Bar


Elena: Hello?
Jenna: Elena?
Elena: Jenna! Hold on, it's loud in here.
Jenna: Elena, where are you? Are you okay?
Elena: Huh? Yeah. No, I'm good. Everything's fine. Hold on, I can't hear you.
Jenna: No, it's not fine! I got a call...


Elena: Hello ?




Bree: Hey, where's your girl?
Damon: Hmm. She was right back there.


Elena: Damon, no!


Damon: What the hell?!


Elena: No!


Damon: Who are you?
Lee: That's perfect! You have no idea.
Elena: What are you talking about? What did he do?
Lee: He killed my girlfriend. What did she do to you, huh? What did she do to you?!
Damon: Nothing.
Elena: I don't understand.
Lee: My girlfriend went to visit Stefan, and Damon killed her. Got it?


Damon: Ahhhhh.
Elena: Lexi? Lexi was your girlfriend? She told me about you. She said that you were human.
Lee: I was.
Elena: Lexi turned you?
Lee: If you want to be with someone forever, you have to live forever.
Elena: She loved you. She said that, When it's real, you can't walk away.
Lee: Well, that's a choice you're not going to have to make.
Elena: Don't. Don't, please, don't hurt him...


Lee: I'm doing you a favor.
Elena: Lexi loved you! And she was good! And that means you're good too. Be better than him. Don't do this. I'm begging you! Please.


Elena: Thank you.
Lee: It wasn't for you.


Gram's Residence
Grams: Well, now, look who's returned from battle. Can I talk to your friend for a minute?
Bonnie:  Thank you.


Grams: I appreciate your help, Stefan.
Stefan: You're welcome, Sheila.
Grams:  I wasn't sure you remembered.
Stefan: October 1969.
Grams: I was barely a teenager!
Stefan: And you were leading what was probably the only anti-war sit-in within miles of Mystic Falls.
Grams: Hmm. 
Stefan: You know, when you spoke, people were mesmerized. I know I was.
Grams: Until the cops showed up.  You took a big risk coming to see me earlier. Letting me read you, realize who you were. It could have gone in a completely different way.
Stefan: Your family has a very long history of keeping my secret. I knew that I could trust you if you believed I was worthy of your trust.
Grams: Bonnie knows, doesn't she?
Stefan: Yes.
Grams: Please understand, our loyalty can only extend so far. This town won't be easy on any of us if they figure it out. And I'll protect my own before anybody else.
Stefan: I know that.
Grams: As long as we're clear. Goodnight, then.
Stefan: Goodnight, Sheila.
Bree's Bar


Damon:  We were just leaving, I wanted to say good bye.
Bree:  Good to see you again, Damon.
Damon: No kiss?
Bree:  I'm full of vervain. I put it in everything I drink.
Damon: And you're telling me this why?
Bree: Lexi was my friend. How could you?  The tomb can be opened.
Damon:  You're lying!
Bree: Emily's grimoire, her spellbook. If you know how she closed the tomb the reversal process will be in her book. You can open that tomb.
Damon: Where is this book?
Bree: I--I--
Damon: You have no idea.
Bree: No. I'm telling you the truth.
Damon: And I believe you. My dear, sweet Bree. That's why I'm almost sorry.


Bree: Ugh!


On The Road


Elena: So, why did you bring me with you?
Damon: Well, you're not the worst company in the world, Elena. You should give yourself more credit!
Elena: Seriously?
Damon: You were there in the road, all damsel-in-distress-like. And, I knew it would piss off Stefan. And...you're not the worst company in the world, Elena.
Elena: I used to be more fun.
Damon: You did okay.
Elena: I saved your life!
Damon: I know.
Elena:  And don't you forget it!
Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Hi.
Stefan: Hi.
Elena: You could have told me.
Stefan: I wanted to tell you.
Elena: You said no more lies. Only the truth. I can handle the truth, Stefan. As crazy as it is, I can handle the fact that you are a vampire. And that you have a vampire brother. And that my best friend is a witch. I can accept the fact that the world is a much more mysterious place than I ever thought possible. But this...this lie, I cannot take. What am I to you? Who am I to you?
Stefan: You are not Katherine. You are the opposite of everything that she was.
Elena: And when did you figure that out? Before you kissed me? Before we slept together?
Stefan: Before I met you.
Elena: What?
Stefan: The first day of school. When we met. It wasn't for the first time, Elena.
Elena: Then when was it?
Stefan: May 23, 2009.
Elena: But that was...
Stefan: That was the day your parents' car went off the bridge.
Elena: You were there?
Stefan: Every couple of years I come back here, to see Zach and see my home. Last spring, I was out in the woods, by old Wickery Bridge. And I heard the accident. All of it. I was fast getting there, but not fast enough. The car was already submerged. Your dad was still...he was still conscious. I was able to get to him, but he wouldn't let me help him, until I helped you.


Elena: Oh my god. When I woke up in the hospital, nobody could figure out how I got out of the car. They said it was a miracle.
Stefan: I went back for them. But it was too late. I couldn't-- I couldn't save them. When I pulled you out, I looked at your face. You looked like Katherine. I couldn't believe the resemblance. After that, I spent months making sure that you weren't her. I watched you. I learned everything that I could about you. And I saw that you were nothing like Katherine. And I wanted to leave town, but, Elena, I couldn't. I couldn't leave without knowing you. I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you. I wanted to. But you were so sad.
Elena: Why do I look like her?
Stefan: Elena, you've been through so much.
Elena: Why do I look like her, Stefan? What are you not telling me?
Stefan: It didn't make any sense to me. You were a Gilbert. She was a Pierce. But the resemblance was too similar. And then I learned the truth.  You were adopted, Elena.
Mystic Falls Library


Anna: There you are.
Jeremy: Hey.
Anna: Hi. Okay, look. I know I don't know you, so don't ask me why I did this. I just, sometimes...mostly all the time- I have this need to be right. So I googled and...


Jeremy: What is it?
Anna: Proof. Sort of.


Jeremy: What does this mean?
Anna: Well, I only went as far back as 1942, and found that there's been a string of animal attacks periodically in and around this town for the past seventy-five years. It's consistent. In '62, five bodies found. In '53, four people killed. In '74, three people dead. And there's been five this year. All attacked. All suffered major blood loss, as in drained of blood.
Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: How do you know all this?
Stefan: Your birth certificate from the city records. It says Elena Gilbert, Mystic Falls General. But there's no record of your mother ever being admitted. There's no record of her ever being pregnant.
Elena: What else do you know?
Stefan: For me to go any further, I would've had to look into the Pierce family, and I couldn't do that. It's too much of a risk. If someone found out I was asking about Katherine...Listen to me, it doesn't matter. You are the woman that I love. I love you.


Gilbert Residence


Jenna: I don't set a lot of rules, Elena. Not with you. I trust you to tell me the truth. Where were you? Why would you lie to me about it? I thought that we were closer than that.
Elena: Now is not the time you want to talk to me about lies.
Jenna: Don't do that. Don't turn this back on me. I didn't do anything.


Elena: Okay...Question: am I adopted? I trust you to tell me the truth too, Jenna. How could you not tell me? I thought we were closer than that.
Jenna: Elena, I didn't...they asked me not to.
Elena: I don't want to hear it! 
Mystic Grill


Damon: Bourbon.


Isobel: I love you.
Alaric: I'm going to be late tonight.




Gilbert Residence


Elena: Stefan, who was that man in the road?
Stefan: I don't know. Do you remember anything else about him?
Elena: I wish. I never really saw his face. He was wearing a hoodie. All I can remember is that there was these black boots coming towards me.
Stefan: I brought some vervain for, um, for you and Jenna. 
Elena:  Wow. So much to remember.
Stefan: I know, but there's another vampire in town. So until we find out who it is and what he wants, we have to be careful.




Noah: Hey. It's gonna be $22. 
Jeremy:  Elena, I need the money! Uh, here. Come in. Just put it on the table.


Elena: Hi. Um, keep the change.


Noah: Thanks. And you have yourself a good night.




Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: What are you lookin' for, Damon?
Damon: Not your concern.
Stefan: No, but putting Elena in harm's way, that is my concern.
Damon:  Hm hm. What are you talking about?
Stefan: I'm talking about Atlanta.
Damon:  Oh, yeah. Elena and I had blast.
Stefan: I get it. You're just bitter because one of us gets to be with the person that we love, and poor Katherine is just out of reach. Unless there's another way for you to get into that tomb. Is that what Bree said?
Damon: You're pathetic when you're fishing.
Stefan: And you're transparent when you're deflecting.
Damon: Don't you have school?


Mystic Falls High School


Alaric: Surprised? It's a good essay. Your thoughts are clear, and your argument is well laid out. It's just, uh, you don't actually think there are vampires in Mystic Falls.


Jeremy: No. I mean, I think statistically there's been more animal attacks, mysterious deaths, uh, people gone missing, more than any other place in the whole commonwealth of Virginia.
Alaric: It's conjecture, but creative, which is why you got the A. I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up in the whole conspiracy theory of it all.
Jeremy: Ah, I won't.


Alaric: Oh, uh, Jeremy,the source that you cited for the 1860s info, uh, Johnathan Gilbert...?


Jeremy: Oh, my ancestor's journal?
Alaric: I'd really like to see that sometime.
Jeremy: Really?
Alaric: A first-person account of the Civil War? That's like, uh, porn for a history teacher.


Jeremy: You think my essay's creative, wait till you get a load of this thing.


Alaric: Thank you.




Caroline: It's so pretty. Thank you. God, it'll go with, like, everything. What's the occasion?
Elena: No occasion. Just a little friend gift.


Caroline: Lesbian friend necklace? Cause we're freaky like that?


Elena: Your friendship is important to me.
Caroline: Why are you being so mushy?
Elena: Because you've been avoiding me, and I wanted you to know that whatever is going on with you and Matt, it's ok.
Caroline: I was gonna talk to you about that. I was, but there's just not much to say. You know, we've hung out a couple times. That's it, but...I just feel like we've peeked as friends.  This is weird. I shouldn't be talking to you about this. It's weird. It's weird, right?
Elena: It's a little weird, but  if it's what you and Matt want, then it's not about me.
Caroline: But it's all about you. Matt's not over you, and we all know it.
Elena: I'm with Stefan now. Matt understands that. He knows he has to move on.


Mystic Grill


Ben McKittrick: Matt Donovan. What do you know?
Matt: Ben McKittrick. What's up, man?
Ben McKittrick: Rough season, bud.
Matt: Yeah. It's kind of hard to recover when you have to forfeit half your games.
Ben McKittrick: You gonna be workin' here?
Matt: Yep, followin' in your footsteps, minus the state championship.
Ben McKittrick: Well, we can't all be Football Gods.
Matt: Yeah.
Ben McKittrick: So what's the plan? Cook line?
Matt: Busboy.


Bonnie: I can't believe you're adopted. I never saw that coming.
Elena: And it gets weirder. I looked at my birth certificate. It lists Miranda and Grayson Gilbert as my birthparents. None of it makes any sense.
Bonnie: Which is why you should ask Jenna.


Bonnie: First of all, the Elena I know would always want the real truth, good or bad.
Elena: And second of all?
Bonnie: You just found out your boyfriend is a  How bad could it be?
Elena: Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store. My outfit for the dance is severely lacking accessories.


Bonnie: Ok, I'll pay the bill.
Elena: Ok. Bye.


Bonnie: Bye.


Bonnie: What do you want from me?
Damon: I think we need a fresh start.
Bonnie: You tried to kill me.
Damon: But I didn't, and if I wanted to, I would have. Does that not count for anything?
Bonnie: You know, I can start fires with my mind. Fires kill vampires, right?  Just stay the hell away from me.


Ben McKittrick: Everything ok over here?
Damon: Yeah, we're fine.
Ben McKittrick: I wasn't talkin' to you.


Bonnie: Thank you.
Ben McKittrick: Anytime, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Wait. You remember me?
Ben McKittrick: I didn't graduate that long ago. You're makin' me feel old.
Bonnie: No, sorry. I didn't...I didn't mean that. I just, I didn't know you knew me.
Ben McKittrick: I always know a pretty face.




Elena:  Hello.
Noah: Hello, Elena.
Elena: Hey, who's this?


Noah: You hit me with your car.


Noah: Is that a new one?


Noah: You got away from me. You won't next time


Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Why me? What does he want with me? A-and if he's trying to kill me, then why call first?


Stefan: That's because we're predators, Elena. We hunt. We stalk. It's often as exciting as the kill. I want you to take this.


Elena: This is Jeremy's pocket watch. How did you get it?
Stefan: I took it from Damon, who took it from Logan, who must have taken it from you.


Elena: What happened to it?
Stefan: Well, it's not just a watch. It's a...it's a sort of compass, but it points to vampires.


Elena: Why did my father have it?
Stefan: Gilberts were one of the founding families, and back in 1864, they were among those who sought to eradicate the vampires. The compass was used to find us.
Elena: Did you know them?
Stefan: Yes. I want you to keep this. That way, you'll know if you're ever in danger.


Mystic Falls High School


Matt: I've never seen you such a mess.
Caroline:  Don't talk smack.


Matt: I mean,  I just thought that you told everyone else what to do.


Caroline: Well, I do that, too, but if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. You know, I just like that we're hanging out. Who knew, you and me?
Matt: Well, who knew you could be fun?


Caroline: So what are you wearing to this dumb dance, anyway? Should we color-coordinate?
Matt: Uh, I'm not goin'.
Caroline: Why not?
Matt: I gotta work, bussin' tables at the Grill.
Caroline: Since when are you a busboy?
Matt: It's a job. You know, some of us have to work, Caroline. With our mom in and out, things are tight, so...
Caroline:  Well, I didn't mean it like that. I just meant that I didn't know you had a job.
Matt: Well, I do. I gotta go.


Mystic Grill


Anna: Hey. How'd it go?
Jeremy: What?
Anna: The paper.
Jeremy: Oh. I got an A. Thanks for the articles. They really helped.
Anna: Cool. So what'd he say about the vampires? Did he believe it?
Jeremy: I don't even believe it. It's just a paper, Anna. Anyways, I, uh, I gotta get goin'.


Anna: Uh, hey, um...D-do you wanna do something later, maybe?
Jeremy: Uh, sorry. I'm stuck on punch duty at the school dance.
Anna: Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?
Jeremy: Well, I'm failin' English, so I copped a plea.
Anna: Maybe, you know, tomorrow or something.


Anna: I'm being pushy again, aren't I? Heh.
Jeremy: Well, thanks for the help. I'll, I'll see you around.


Gilbert Residence


Jenna: Spoke to the insurance company. Car's totaled. You can keep using mine for now.
Elena: So you're coming to the dance?
Jenna:  Alaric asked me to help chaperone.


Elena: Why didn't you tell me, Jenna?


Jenna: Your mom was gonna do it eventually. I never thought I'd have to.
Elena: If my mom were here right now and I asked, she'd tell me the truth.
Jenna: Your dad was about to leave the office one night when this girl showed up. She was sixteen, a runaway, and about to give birth. He delivered her baby, and he gave her a place to stay, but a few days later, she disappeared. And there you were. Your parents were trying so hard to have a baby. I-it just wasn't happening. All Miranda ever wanted was to be a mom.
Elena: Well, why were my parents' names on the birth certificate?
Jenna: Your dad was a doctor, Elena. He took care of it. They didn't wanna lose you, so they kept it quiet, told as few people as possible, but if anyone ever wanted proof, they had documentation.
Elena: What else do you know about her? The girl?
Jenna: Just her name. Isobel.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon:  Why are you bringing me dad's journal?
Stefan: Cause you were looking for it.
Damon: And why would I want it?
Stefan: Gee, I don't know, Damon. Maybe you wanna do a little bit of posthumous bonding. Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it. I have. Nowhere in it does it say anything about Katherine, or the tomb, or how to open it.


Damon: I'm not surprised. Man could barely spell his own name.
Stefan: I'm really sorry that it won't be of any help with your diabolical plan, the sequel.  You know, I could help you.
Damon: You? Help me? Aw, I don't know. Seems a little unnatural.
Stefan: I'll do anything to get you out of this town, even release Katherine.
Damon: What about the other 26 vampires?
Stefan: No, no, no. They can't come. They have to stay put, but Katherine, I would consider that.
Damon: What are you doin'? Hmm? What's your angle?
Stefan: Think about it.
Damon: Why would I trust you?
Stefan: See that's your problem, Damon. You apply all of your shortcomings to everybody else. If history's any indication, there's only one liar among us.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Hey, Jenna. Jenna? Jeremy?


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Stefan's phone. How may I help you?
Gilbert Residence


Elena: Where is he?
Damon: He's on his way to you. Forgot his phone.


Elena:  Stefan must be here. Thank you.
Damon: You're welcome.


Stefan: Elena!


Stefan: Are you ok? Are you ok?




Damon: How did he get in?
Elena: He was invited in.
Stefan: He posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.
Damon: Well, he gets points for that. Did he say what he wanted?
Elena: No. He was too busy trying to kill me.
Stefan: And you have no idea who this is?
Damon: No.  Don't look at me like that. I told you we had company.
Elena: You think there's more than one?
Damon: We don't know.


Stefan: Damon, he was invited in.


Damon: Then we go get him tonight.  You up for it?
Elena: What do I have to do?
Damon: Let your boyfriend take you to the dance. We'll see who shows up.
Stefan: That's a bad idea.
Damon: Till we get him, this house isn't safe. For anyone who lives in it. It's worth a shot.
Elena: I'll do it.


Elena: I'll be with the two of you. I'll be safe.


Mystic Falls High School


Jenna: Alaric.
Alaric: Hey, look at you.
Jenna: I figured I'd stand out less if I dressed up.
Alaric: Heh heh. Liar.
Jenna: Ok, I'm a sucker for the decade dance. I went to school here, you know. They do the sixties and seventies, too, FYI.
Alaric: Oh. Can't wait. Can I get you a drink? I hear the punch is real boss.




Elena: Having fun?
Caroline: No, but this took about two hours, so I'm at least staying half of that.


Bonnie: What's Damon doing here?


Elena: He wanted to come. I promise. He'll behave.
Caroline: So what is this, like, a threesome now, you and the Salvatore brothers?
Elena: No, but if I'm gonna be with Stefan, then I have to learn to tolerate Damon. It's not like I can kill him.
Bonnie:  There's a thought.
Caroline: Mmm. I'll help.




Jenna: I'm really starting to see a change in Jeremy. Finally.
Alaric: Uh, losing someone you love so suddenly, the, uh, the trauma and the grief there are some of the tougher things he'll face in life.


Jenna: From someone who knows. You have no idea what happened?
Alaric: That's the hard part, not knowing.
Jenna: Is it ok to talk about your wife?
Alaric: Heh. There's not much to talk about.
Jenna: That must be impossible to deal with, not having any answers.
Alaric: I'd be lying to you if I told you it didn't keep me up at night. Wondering why, by who.
Jenna: Maybe one day.
Alaric: Hope so.


Alaric: I hope so.




Damon: Hi, Bonnie. Wanna dance?
Bonnie: I'm out of here.


Damon: Please give me another chance.


Caroline: Back off, Damon.


Elena: Where did they go?
Damon: I don't know.
Stefan: What did you say to them?
Damon: I was perfectly polite. Elena...Would you like to dance?
Elena: I would love to.


Elena: May I have this dance?




Elena: Shouldn't you guys be able to sense each other or something?
Stefan: No. Doesn't work that way. See him anywhere?
Elena: Not unless he has a pompadour.
Stefan: Heh. Wow. Not one of the better fashion trends.
Elena: Come on. I'm sure you looked great back then. Are there pictures?
Stefan: No. Burned. Buried.
Elena: Seriously, what was it like, the fifties? Cause in my mind, I have this picture of somewhere between American Bandstand, Grease. It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.
Stefan: Well, that and, you know, McCarthyism and segregation and nuclear arms race.
Elena: Ok, but there were poodle skirts?
Stefan: There were poodle skirts.


Elena:  You're so teaching me how to do the hand jive.
Stefan: No. That's not gonna happen.
Elena: Ooh!




Anna: You neglected to mention this was a theme party.
Jeremy: What are you doing here?
Anna: Well, seeing as you also neglected to invite me, I took matters into my own hands.
Jeremy: You're doin' that thing again.
Anna: What thing would that be?
Jeremy: That thing where you pretend we're dating, even though we're not.
Anna:  Get over yourself. Come on. I've never been to a school dance before. Humor me.


Mystic Grill


Bonnie: Let's sit up there.


Caroline: Be a little more obvious, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.


Caroline: What? It's just a drizzle. Ben McKittrick? Really?
Bonnie: He's hot.
Caroline: He's a washed-up jock who pours drinks for a living. You could do way better.


Caroline: Hey.
Matt:  What's up?


Mystic Falls High School


Alaric: Yeah, I don't recognize you. How'd you get roped into chaperoning? Alaric Saltzman. I'm the new history teacher.


Damon: Ah, the, uh, cursed faculty position.
Alaric: So I've been told.
Damon: Damon. Salvatore.
Alaric: Salvatore, as in, uh, Stefan?
Damon: He's my little brother. I'm his legal guardian, hence the chaperoning.
Alaric: I hear he's very bright, not that I've had a chance to see for myself.
Damon: Well, his attendance record's a little spotty. Family drama.
Alaric: No parents?
Damon: Mm, it's just the two of us now.
Alaric: You, uh, you live here your whole life?
Damon: On and off. Travel a bit.
Alaric: Really? Where? Around the states?  Heh. I'm sorry. I'm nosy. I...I don't mean to pry. Look, it was nice meeting you.
Damon: You, too.
Alaric: Enjoy the rest of the dance.


Mystic Grill


Caroline: Tonight was so much better on paper.
Bonnie: Ah, you're just feeling sorry for yourself. Go and talk to him. Be bold and fearless.
Caroline: Yeah, this coming from the girl who's been eye stalking the bartender.
Bonnie: You're right.


Bonnie: Hi.
Ben McKittrick: Twice in one day. Lucky me.
Bonnie: I'm proving something to my friend.
Ben McKittrick: Oh, yeah? What's that?
Bonnie: That you don't have to sit around and wait for a guy to come up to you.
Ben McKittrick: Does that mean that you're asking me out on a date?
Bonnie: Does that mean you want me to?
Ben McKittrick: Well, what did you have in mind?
Bonnie:  Do you like karaoke?
Ben McKittrick: No.  But I would really like to go on a date with you.


Caroline: Seriously?


Matt: Is that for me?
Caroline: Do you see anyone else in the vicinity?
Matt: Do you need something?
Caroline: Are you mad at me or something?
Matt: No, Care. I'm not mad. I...
Caroline: Well, then why are you being so weird?
Matt: I'm not. I'm working.
Caroline: You're avoiding.
Matt: No. I have a table to clean. You know, that's the kind of thing that washed-up jocks do to make a living.


Mystic Falls High School


Jeremy: You don't go to school here. You know, you don't have to help.
Anna: Oh, I don't mind. It's fun. Oh, um, yeah. Before I forget, can I borrow your ancestor's journal?
Jeremy: Why?
Anna: You said I could read it.
Jeremy: Uh, I don't have it.
Anna: Oh. Well, obviously you didn't bring it here, uh, but I can walk you home.
Jeremy: No. I mean, I gave it to my history teacher.
Anna: Wait. Why did you give it to him?
Jeremy: Because he wanted to read it.
Anna: You know, you shouldn't be giving that to just anybody.
Jeremy: But I should give it to you?
Anna: Loan. Loan it to me.
Jeremy: Well, I loaned it to Mr. Saltzman.
Anna: Maybe he's in his classroom. We can get it back.
Jeremy: What's the big deal with this stupid journal?


Jeremy:  Your eye.


Anna: Um, there's something in it. Forget it. I...I gotta go.




Elena: Maybe he's not gonna show.
Stefan: You mean we did all this dancing for nothing?


Elena: Ahh. The horror.


Stefan: I'm really sorry for all this.
Elena: It's my choice. I decided to be here. I officially signed up for it, so I don't wanna hear you apologizing anymore.


Elena: Show me how it's done in the fifties.
Stefan: Uh, no.
Elena: Come on. One move?


Stefan: Now you remember that, because it's never gonna happen again.




Noah: What are you doing here?
Anna: Trying to get the journal, as in sticking to the plan, something you're not doing.  Leave the girl alone.
Noah: I like her. She looks like Katherine.
Anna: She's not Katherine. Ok, Katherine is in the tomb.
Noah: I know, but until we open that tomb, I got her to play with.
Anna: Don't be stupid. That girl is with the Salvatore brothers.
Noah: They don't scare me. They never have.
Anna: Please, Noah. Don't do this. You're gonna ruin everything.
Noah: You got nothing to worry about. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. You will get what you came for. Just let me have my fun.  She looks like Katherine.




Elena: You really can't take him anywhere, can you?
Stefan: Uh, no.


Elena: Stefan, the back corner.


Stefan: Get Damon.


Boy:  What did I do?


Stefan: Where is he?
Boy: I was getting a soda, and then this guy gave me his hoodie.




Noah: Hello, Elena. There's an exit door behind you. You have five seconds.
Elena: No.
Noah: Or your brother dies.


Noah: I can snap his neck so fast I bet there's not even a witness. Now, start walking.
Elena:  Don't you dare touch him.
Noah: Keep walking. Through the door.


Damon: Hey, dickhead.  Nobody wants to kill you. We just wanna talk.


Stefan: Now you feel like talkin'?
Noah: Screw you.


Stefan: Wrong answer. Why are you doing this?
Noah: Because it's fun.


Stefan: What do you want with Elena?
Noah: She looks like Katherine.


Damon: You knew Katherine?
Noah: Oh. You thought you were the only ones.  You don't even remember me.


Damon: Tell me how to get in the tomb. Hmm?
Noah: No.


Noah: The grimoire.
Damon: Where is it?


Noah: Check the journal. The journal. Johnathan's journal. Johnathan Gilbert's.


Stefan: Who else is working with you?


Damon: Who else is there?
Noah: No. You're gonna have to kill me.


Elena: What do we...how are you gonna find the others now?
Damon: He had to die.
Elena: But...
Stefan: Elena, he's been invited in.


Stefan: Go. I got this.


Alaric:  Hey.


Damon: What were you doing?
Alaric: Looking for Ms. Hilden.
Damon: Why are you in Mystic Falls?
Alaric: I got a job as a teacher.
Damon: Do you know what I am?
Alaric: You're my student's brother.
Damon: Is everything you're telling me the truth?
Alaric: Yes.
Damon: Then forget we had this conversation.




Damon: There's no way that idiot was workin' alone.
Stefan: You are.  So the grimoire...That was Emily's, right? That's what you need to reverse the spell. When the founding families burned her, they took her things, and you were hoping that dad's journal would tell you where it is.
Damon: Look at you puttin' the pieces together. Good for you. I was half-right. Well, it's out there now. Let the games begin.
Stefan: My offer still stands.
Damon: Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no doubt.
Stefan: No. Nothing hidden about it. No lies. No deception. I'm there when you open up that tomb, you and Katherine go, and the other 26 vampires die.
Damon: If I agree?
Stefan: I'll help you.
Damon: Why should I trust you?
Stefan: Because I'm your brother.
Damon: No, that's not gonna cut it.
Stefan: Because I want you gone.


Damon: Ok.


Mystic Grill


Caroline: Look I said something stupid. I'm sorry, but I wasn't even talking about you.


Matt: Yes, you were, Caroline. Ben could easily be me. We're just alike.
Caroline: That's not true. Are you seriously mad about this? Matt, you know me. Ok, I say stupid things without thinking, and then I have to apologize and take it back, and...I'm a terrible, awful person, but I'm working on it.
Matt: Look, can we just not do this right now?
Caroline: Ok. When do you get off?
Matt: Look, this thing that we've got, it's nice, and it feels really good, and I know you want to take the next step.
Caroline: How do you know that? Have you even asked me?
Matt: I'm...I'm not over Elena. I mean, I don't know if I am, but if we go there, then it could mess things up, and we might lose this, and this is the only good thing I've got going for me right now. So if it doesn't work, I'll just disappoint you and hurt you, and I don't wanna do that.
Caroline: Well, big problem, Matt, because you took the next step all by yourself, and you played the whole thing out in your head, and you decided to bail before even giving it a shot. So this really great thing that we have, don't worry about losing it, 'cause it's already gone.


Gilbert Residence


Jenna: Thank you. I needed that.
Alaric: Well, thank you for, for coming. I...I really appreciate it. You made the evening much more...Well, you made it, period.
Jenna: I'm glad I could help.
Alaric: And thank you for putting up with all that wife talk. I...I gotta stop doin' that. It doesn't bode well for dating.
Jenna: Is that what this was, a date?
Alaric: No, definitely not a date.
Jenna: Oh.
Alaric: But Friday...You, me, and dinner and a movie, that could be a date. How about it?
Jenna:  Uh, you can talk about your wife all you want. It's gonna take time to heal. We should just be ourselves.
Alaric: Still, I think I'll keep the Isobel talk to a minimum.
Jenna: Isobel?
Alaric: Yeah. That was her name.
Jenna: Where was Isobel from?
Alaric: Virginia. I mean, not too- -not too far from here, actually.


Mystic Falls


Matt: Caroline!


Matt: Care, get in the truck.


Caroline:  What?


Matt: This'll never work.


Gilbert Residence


Stefan: Doing ok?


Elena: Is it weird if I say yes?
Stefan: Is it true?
Elena: I should feel more upset or scared or something, but I...feel kind of exhilarated.
Stefan: It's the adrenaline. You'll crash soon enough.


Elena: Yeah, I guess.  I fought back tonight. It felt good.
Stefan: I wish you didn't have to fight at all.
Elena: Still...


Stefan: I need to tell you something, and I don't know how you're gonna feel about it.


Elena: What?
Stefan: I told Damon that I'd help him get into that tomb to get Katherine back. But it was a lie. I let him believe that he could trust me.
Elena: Well, then why would you be worried about telling me?
Stefan: Because he can be very persuasive, and you two have bonded lately.
Elena:  That doesn't mean I trust him. It's gonna take a lot more than just a road trip and a rescue for me to forget who Damon is and everything he's done.
Stefan: I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena, but I can't let him do it.
Elena: Then don't, and I'll help you, whatever it takes. Ok?
Stefan: Ok. Come here.


Mystic Grill


Ben McKittrick: Don't sneak up on me.
Anna: You love it.


Ben McKittrick: Where's Noah?
Anna: His obsession got the best of him, and so did the Salvatore brothers.
Ben McKittrick: They killed him?
Anna: Tortured and staked.
Ben McKittrick: You're not very upset.
Anna: I warned him, Ben, and he was just gonna screw everything up anyway. Let's be honest, he wasn't exactly an asset. How'd you do?
Ben McKittrick: Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me. Did you get the journal?
Anna: No, but I know where it is, and I'll get it.


Mystic Falls 1864


Katherine: Please! Please, help us!


Katherine: Please, my husband, he's been hurt! Please help him!


Man: What are you doing out here in the middle of the night? It's not safe.
Katherine: No. No, sir. It's not safe.


Katherine: And that's how it's done.


Damon: What happens to the bodies?
Katherine: Well, I'll take them into the woods and the other animals will finish them off.  Are you sure you're ready for this?
Damon:  I'm ready. I want you to turn me.
Katherine: When it's time. Kiss me.


Katherine: You should get a taste.


Damon: Sorry.
Katherine: Don't be. Soon you won't be able to get enough.




Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Mmm. Good morning.
Stefan: I could get used to this.
Damon: Rise and shine, sleepyheads.


Elena: Damon! Please!
Stefan: What are you doing?
Damon: Oh, stop being smutty.


Stefan: Seriously, get out of here!
Damon: If I see something I haven't seen before, I'll throw a dollar at it. Now listen, we have some very important business to discuss.
Elena: And it has to be right now?
Damon: Well, we have lots to do, now that we're all friends and working toward a common goal.


Damon: So, in order to open the tomb, we need to find the journal to get the grimoire to undo the spells. First things first-since you are Elena Gilbert, you're on journal duty.
Elena: Since when am I helping?
Damon: Well, Stefan's helping, and you've taken up residence in Stefan's bed, ergo...
Stefan: You don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.
Elena: I'll look for it tonight.


Damon: Good.
Stefan: How do we know that this journal will hold the location of the grimoire? We're really going to take the word of this vampire? He seemed like a bit of a dimwit
Damon: In lieu of any other options.


Elena: OK, what exactly is a grimoire, anyway?
Damon: It's a witch's cookbook.
Stefan: Every spell that a witch casts is unique unto itself, so every witch would document their work.
Damon: Yeah. Cookbook.
Stefan: What about our mystery vampire? Dimwit obviously wasn't working alone, so whoever's out there knows who we are.
Damon: And I don't like that disadvantage, so... Don't screw it up.


Elena: He doesn't--


Elena: Oh, right, yeah.


Stefan: OK.


Elena: Oh! No, come here.


Stefan: We shouldn't-
Elena: Shh.


Salvatore Estate 1864


Katherine: What are you doing? Stop it!


Damon: Make me.


Katherine: Yes?


Emily: Excuse me, Miss Katherine. Miss Pearl is here to see you.
Katherine: I'll be down soon. Please ask her to wait.


Katherine: Thank you, Emily.


Katherine: Fun's over.
Damon: Hmm, no.




Katherine: It's good to see you, Pearl.
Pearl: Perhaps we could talk outside.


Katherine: Emily, would you please tell Mr. Salvatore that I've stepped away?
Emily: Which one?
Katherine:  Both.


Pearl: How long do you plan on staying with the Salvatores? People talk, Katherine. You, carrying on with both brothers, doesn't help the situation.
Katherine: The Salvatores have been kind to take me in. As far as everyone here knows, I'm a poor orphan girl from Atlanta, lost her family in the fires.
Pearl: A match you lit, no doubt.


Pearl: Honey, please be careful!


Pearl: Honoria Fell came by the apothecary yesterday with a case of this elixir.  She asked that it be sold at a reduced rate.
Katherine: I don't follow.
Pearl: Try it.


Katherine: What in hell?!
Pearl: Vervain.
Katherine: Why is there ver, , they know.
Pearl: They're trying to find us, and they're getting crafty about it.
Katherine: The townspeople ingesting vervain? Well, that's inconvenient.


Pearl: It might be time for us to move on again.
Katherine: No. I like it here. I'm not interested in leaving just yet.


Anna: Can we go, Mama?


Anna: Is something wrong?


Motel Room


Anna: Hey, it's me again. Anna. Stalker chick and Foosball champion. I'll be at the Grill later, if you want, you know, a rematch, or whatever.


Ben McKittrick: Who are you calling?
Anna: Jeremy Gilbert.
Ben McKittrick: You're not, like, into him, are you?
Anna: I need him for something. Get over it.


Ben McKittrick: Oh! Mmm! Damn it!
Anna: Dude, you gotta stop doing that.
Ben McKittrick: I know. I just-I keep forgetting.
Anna: You're new. You'll get it.


Ben McKittrick: You found the Gilbert journal?
Anna: Does that look like the Gilbert journal?
Ben McKittrick: Well, it's old and musty, and how am I supposed to know the difference?
Anna: I don't know, I figured maybe, just maybe, you've been paying a little bit of attention since we met.
Ben McKittrick:  You know, you don't have to talk down to me. I'm not stupid.


Anna: Here. Drink. I don't want you getting itchy around the witch. She can sense if you're weak.


Ben McKittrick: When can we go hunting again? This tastes old. I want fresh blood.
Anna: When we get that tomb open, you can kill anyone you want. For now, just stay focused on Bonnie while I try to get the journal back from Jeremy's teacher.
Ben McKittrick: Why did you choose me?
Anna: I needed someone in a position to be my eyes and ears. Small town bartender fit the bill.
Ben McKittrick: There are plenty of bartenders to choose from. Why me?
Anna: You were sad, Ben. You lacked purpose. You needed me.
Gilbert Residence


Elena: Do you think Damon really believes us? That we're both trying to help him?
Stefan: I don't think Damon knows what to believe. Trust isn't something that comes naturally to him.
Elena: You know...I really think that Damon believes that everything he's done, every move that he's made, he's done for love. It's twisted, but kind of sad.
Stefan: There are other ways to get what you want. You don't have to kill people. Damon has no regard for human life. He enjoys inflicting pain on others. For 145 years, every single time that I have let my guard down and let Damon back into my life, he's done something to make me regret that. I'm not going to make that mistake again.
Elena: So what do you think will happen if the tomb gets opened and Damon gets Katherine back?
Stefan: I think that no matter what Damon promises, a lot of people will die.


Stefan: That's Johnathan Gilbert.


Elena: What's this?


Jeremy: What are you guys doing?
Elena: Hey. Just going through some stuff, feeling sentimental. Dad had this old family journal from years ago. I thought I'd dig it up.


Jeremy: Johnathan Gilbert's journal?
Elena: Yeah, what do you know about it?
Jeremy: I just did a history report on it.
Elena: Oh. So where is it now?
Jeremy: I gave it to Mr. Saltzman. He wanted to see it.


Mystic Falls High School


Alaric:  I met Barnette and Giuseppe this evening. I saw the skepticism in their eyes when I showed them the compass.
Salvatore Estate 1864


Giuseppe: We're supposed to believe that can track one of them?
Barnette: What is it, magic?
Johnathan: It's science.
Barnette: I'll believe it when I see it.
Giuseppe: I've been thinking about this church idea. I believe it could work.


Stefan: Excuse me, father. I didn't know you had guests.
Giuseppe: We'll be done in a few minutes, son.
Stefan: I'll come back. Forgive me, Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Lockwood.


Johnathan: Have you told them?
Giuseppe: Not yet.
Johnathan: Giuseppe, we need all the men we can get.
Giuseppe: I'll tell them. You can count on both my boys.
Mystic Falls High School


Alaric: Hello?


Alaric: Hello?


Alaric: Someone there?


Stefan: You shouldn't have done that.


Stefan: Have a seat.


Stefan: What is this, compressed air?  I'm not going to hurt you...unless you try that again.


Stefan: Now...who are you?
Alaric: I'm a teacher.
Stefan: Are we gonna have to do this the hard way?
Alaric: I'm also a historian. And while researching Virginia, I--made a few discoveries about your town.
Stefan: So you show up like Van Helsing. Come on. Tell me the truth.
Alaric: My wife was a parapsychologist. She spent her life researching paranormal activity in this area. It was her work that led me here.
Stefan: Where's your wife?
Alaric: Dead. A vampire killed her.
Stefan: Where's the Gilbert journal?
Alaric: What do you want with it?
Stefan: Where is it?
Alaric: It's on my desk.
Stefan: No, it's not.


Alaric: It was on my desk.
Motel Room


Ben McKittrick: Anything?
Anna: Not yet. Just a lot of gibberish. Yeah, some people just shouldn't journal.
Ben McKittrick: I thought this Gilbert was the brains.


Anna: Don't you have a date?
Ben McKittrick: Yep. Wish me luck.


Johnathan:  I saw her again today--The most beautiful woman in town, with a name just as pretty: Pearl.
Apothecary 1864


Pearl: Have you thought any more of what I've said?
Katherine: We'll leave soon, Pearl, I promise. I need to take care of a few things first.
Pearl: You're going to turn both of them, aren't you?


Pearl: Katherine, please. Be careful.
Katherine: We'll all be safe, I promise.


Katherine: Mr. Gilbert's coming. Quick, your cheeks.  Perfectly rosy.


Johnathan: Miss Pearl. May I have a moment?
Pearl: Yes, Mr. Gilbert. I'm still waiting for you to explain that comet in the sky.


Katherine:  Your mother has an admirer.


Salvatore Estate 1864


Giuseppe: As descendants of the Founding Families, they'll want to know that they can count on you.
Stefan: Of course they can. Is there any doubt?
Giuseppe: I'm not sure your brother Damon understands the importance of duty.
Stefan: Damon left the Confederacy on principle. It was his choice and should be respected.
Giuseppe: You'll forgive me if I have trouble respecting a deserter.
Damon: Well, I never asked for your respect.


Giuseppe: Good for you, Damon. Because all I have is disappointment.


Stefan: You said the town is in trouble?
Giuseppe: There's been too many deaths. It is time for us to fight back and stop these killers.
Stefan: Killers? What are you talking about?
Giuseppe: We live amongst demons.
Damon: You're being cryptic now, father. Why don't you just say the word?
Giuseppe: Vampires. They exist. And they live amongst us. But we have a plan to kill them. And you're going to help us.


Gilbert Residence


Damon: My father never approved of anyone I dated, which only made me want them more. Of course. What about you?
Jenna: There were a few guys. Logan isn't the only loser I've dated.
Damon: They ever find him? Or is he still missing?
Jenna: He's not missing. He's in the Bahamas working on his tan. Very entitled, that one. Marches to his own drum.  He's a Fell. They're all snooty.


Damon: Hello, Elena.


Jenna: Hey. Where have you been? We're cooking dinner.
Damon: Is Stefan with you?
Elena: Um - he'll be here soon.


Mystic Falls High School


Stefan: How long have you been aware of me?
Alaric: I learned just recently. What about your brother?
Stefan: You met Damon.
Alaric: Who do you think killed my wife?
Stefan: Are you certain it was Damon?
Alaric: I witnessed it.
Stefan: If you're here for revenge, this is going to end very badly for you.
Alaric: I just want to find out what happened to my wife.
Stefan: I thought you just said that Damon...
Alaric: Yeah. I saw him draining the life out of her. He must have heard me coming. He just...disappeared. So did her body. They never found her.
Stefan: Damon can never know why you're here. He'll kill you without blinking.
Alaric: I can take care of myself.
Stefan:  No, you can't. I can help you. If you let me.
Gilbert Residence


Damon: Whoa. Mmm.


Elena: Don't do that.
Damon: Do what?
Elena: You know what. That move was deliberate.
Damon: Well, yeah, I was deliberately trying to get to the sink.


Damon: Speaking of Stefan, where is he? He's missing family night, which I am enjoying immensely.


Damon: Is it real?
Elena: Is what real?
Damon: This renewed sense of brotherhood.  Can I trust him?
Elena:  Yes, you can trust him.


Damon: Can I trust him?
Elena: I'm wearing vervain, Damon. It's not going to work.
Damon: I'm not compelling you. I just want you to answer me. Honestly.
Elena: Of course you can.


Salvatore Estate 1864


Katherine: You can trust me, Mr. Salvatore. I would never cheat.


Giuseppe:  I'm losing over here. Again!


Damon: She's good. I almost believe she genuinely likes him.
Stefan: Perhaps she does.
Damon:  She knows father would have her killed if he knew the truth.
Stefan: Not if we talk to him; explained how we feel. He could help us keep her safe.


Damon: Have you gone mad? No, no, father would drive the stake in her himself!
Stefan: That's not true. We can trust him.
Damon: No, no, not with this. Please, promise me you won't tell him, Stefan.


Stefan: I promise.
Gilbert Residence
Damon: There was a time when I trusted him more than anyone.
Elena: Trust breeds trust. You have to give it to get it.
Damon: Are you lecturing me?
Elena:  Do you need to be lectured?
Damon: I just want her back. I'm sure you can understand that.
Elena: I can understand that you would do anything for her, yes.


Damon: Then you understand what I will do if anyone gets in my way.




Jeremy: You said you never played this thing before.
Damon: I'm a fast learner. Quick reflexes.


Damon: Who are you dodging?
Jeremy: This girl Anna. She can be, uh, persistent.
Damon: Is she hot?
Jeremy: Yeah, yeah, but she can be weird.
Damon: Hot trumps weird, trust me.




Jenna:  He is ridiculously hot!
Elena: Shh!


Elena:  He's an ass.


Jenna: What are you doing with all this stuff?
Elena: I thought there might be something about my birth parents.
Jenna: Have you told Jeremy?
Elena: I will. When the time is right.


Elena: That's Stefan.


Jeremy: Dude!


Damon: Well?

Ben McKittrick: Admit it. I can't sing.
Bonnie: No. You were great.
Ben McKittrick: Come on, I totally trashed a Metallica song.
Bonnie: Well, first mistake, Metallica karaoke?
Ben McKittrick: Well, at least I could admit it.
Bonnie: The woman with the tattoos loved you.
Ben McKittrick: Yeah, well, next time, I'm going to throw out my Pearl Jam.
Bonnie: Next time?
Ben McKittrick: Yeah. So, uh, what are your friends up to tonight?
Bonnie: They're all doing their own thing. Caroline's at her dad's, Elena's with her boyfriend.
Ben McKittrick: Elena Gilbert, right?
Bonnie: Yeah.
Ben McKittrick: Yeah, I remember. You guys used to hang out.
Bonnie: She's my best friend.
Ben McKittrick: Yeah, my friends, they all moved away after graduation, and I didn't. So we just kind of drifted apart.
Bonnie: Oh. Elena and I are bonded for life. I can't imagine it any other way.
Ben McKittrick: That tight, huh?
Bonnie: She's my sister. I mean, I'd die for her.


Gilbert Residence


Damon: Who took it?
Stefan: I don't know.
Damon: You know what, it's that teacher. There's something really off about him.
Stefan: No, he doesn't know anything. Somebody got to it right before me.
Damon: Who else knew it was there?


Elena: No. Damon, leave him out of it!
Damon: Why, what's the big deal?
Elena: Damon!


Damon: So....I heard you found a really cool journal from back in the day. Who else did you show it to?
Jeremy: Huh?
Damon: Don't ask questions, just spill.
Jeremy:  You're kidding me, right?
Elena: Jer, did you tell anyone other than Mr. Saltzman about Johnathan Gilbert's journal?
Jeremy: Why is everybody so obsessed with that thing?
Elena: Who else did you tell?
Jeremy: Just that girl Anna.
Damon: The hot, weird one?
Jeremy: Yeah.
Stefan: Wait, who is Anna?
Damon: That's what I want to find out.


Damon: How do you know her?
Jeremy: I just know her. She wants me to meet her at the Grill tonight.
Damon: Perfect. I'll drive. Come on.
Jeremy: O-Okay.




Elena: OK, I'm alone. Give me all the deets, Bonnie. I'm dying.
Bonnie: It's going great. He's a perfect gentleman.
Elena: Gentleman, huh?
Bonnie: I know! Boring, huh? I just want to grab him and lay one on him.
Elena: So, why don't you?
Bonnie: 'Cause I'm a chicken.
Elena:  You're a powerful witch goddess. Come on, seize the day, Broomhilda.
Bonnie:  Okay. I'm going to text you later with more details.
Elena: You better.


Elena: Where's Damon?
Stefan: He left to track down Jeremy's friend Anna, see if there was anything there.
Elena: Aren't you going to go with him? If he gets to the journal before we do, then...


Stefan: Doesn't matter.


Elena: What is that?
Stefan: It's a copy of it.
Elena: How did you get it?
Stefan: Well, Mr. Saltzman made a copy and was kind enough to loan it to me.
Elena:  He did?
Stefan: Not exactly, but I got it.


Mystic Grill


Anna: You just couldn't live without me, huh?
Jeremy: Well, I kinda miss my daily dose of cute stalker chick.
Anna: Oh, funny.
Jeremy: Let's play.


Apothecary 1864


Pearl: The sheriff was here earlier. He bought large volumes of the vervain elixir.
Katherine: Did he try to put his hands on you again?
Pearl: Doesn't he always?
Katherine:  She's saving herself for Johnathan Gilbert.
Pearl: I'm beyond saving. We know that.


Damon: How can you be so calm? They're getting closer to you every day.
Katherine: We are the respectable ladies of Mystic Falls. Thanks to Emily, we walk the streets in daylight. No one will ever suspect us.
Pearl:  Not unless a human tells them.
Damon: I'd sooner die.
Katherine: And soon enough, you will.


Anna: Mrs. Fell is approaching.
Pearl: Thank you, Annabelle.

Gilbert Residence


Elena: Here's a reference that he wrote about Emily.  Is that your father?


Stefan: Yeah.


Stefan: It was Giuseppe Salvatore who removed my fear. He told me he would protect the secret of the spell book. He said he would carry it to his grave.


Salvatore Estate 1864


Giuseppe: Stefan. To what do I owe this pleasure?
Stefan: Did I interrupt your writing?
Giuseppe: These are the dull musings of my troubled mind.
Stefan: A great mind.
Giuseppe: Still. I will carry the real secrets with me-
Stefan: To your grave.
Giuseppe: And a full grave it will be.


Giuseppe: Now, speaking of troubled minds, what's on yours?
Stefan: I have concerns about your plan for the vampires.
Giuseppe: And why is that?
Stefan: We are making the assumption that all vampires are as evil as they've been characterized, but what if that's not true?
Giuseppe: Do you have any evidence to the contrary? Do you know of any vampires?
Stefan: No. No, of course not. But are we to take what others say at face value? You always taught us so differently.


Giuseppe: Stefan...These creatures are of the darkest parts of Hell. They have the ability to control your mind, seduce your spirit. They are deadly. They must be destroyed.  Those who stand with them; those who bring shame to their families will be destroyed as well.


Gilbert Residence


Stefan: I know where it is.

Damon:  OK, I give. OK.


Damon: Damn. You're strong for a little thing.
Anna: I was wondering how long it would take you to find me.
Old Cemetery


Elena: Why isn't your father buried in your family's tomb?
Stefan: It wasn't built until well after he died.
Elena: Are you sure the grimoire's in there with him?
Stefan: As sure as I could be.
Elena: Great.


Stefan: Elena. I can do this on my own.
Elena: And I said I would do whatever I can to help.
Stefan: I know, and I appreciate that, but-
Elena: This town is my home, Stefan. My friends and family are here. You're here. I don't want that tomb opened any more than you do.


Elena: I'm sorry that you have to do this.
Salvatore Estate 1864


Stefan: What is that?
Katherine: A gift.
Stefan: From Damon?
Katherine: From Emily, actually. And when will you stop worrying about Damon?


Stefan: I want you all to myself.
Katherine: Just as he wants me, but I'm the one who gets to make all the rules.
Stefan: And why is that?
Katherine: Because I'm spoiled.
Stefan: Yes, you are.


Katherine: And selfish.


Katherine: And because I can do this.


Katherine: And this.


Katherine: And this.


Stefan: What? What?
Katherine: Vervain.
Stefan: What?


Stefan: Katherine! Katherine!


Giuseppe: Go get the sheriff. Tell him we have a vampire.
Stefan: What? No!
Giuseppe: Do as I say, son! Nothing that you feel for her is real. She's a vampire, Stefan! A monster! I fed you vervain hoping that it would expose her.
Stefan: How did you know?
Giuseppe: Your sympathy for their plight. I didn't raise my sons to be so weak.  The sheriff, now. Go, quickly! Now, son!


Old Cemetery


Motel Room


Damon: How long have you been here?
Anna: I arrived around half-past comet, watching you screw up every chance you had to open that tomb.
Damon: How did you know about the spell?
Anna: I didn't say much back then, which means I heard everything.


Damon: So if you've been here the whole time, then why are we just crossing paths right now?


Anna: I like to use others to do my dirty work.
Damon: Like Logan Fell? Oh, yeah, thanks for that, by the way. Little bastard shot me.
Anna: Logan was an idiot.
Damon: Mm-hmm.
Anna: We slipped him some blood when he started getting all poser slayer with that compass. I needed his family's journal. I couldn't let him die.
Damon: What'd you want with the Fell journal?
Anna: I thought it contained the location of the witch's spell book. I was wrong. According to her journal, Honoria gave the grimoire to Johnathan Gilbert. And, according to this...


Anna: He gave it to your father. So now you're going to help me find it.
Damon: Why would I help you?
Anna: 'Cause you and I both want that tomb open.


Damon: Hmm.  Sorry. I work alone.

Ben McKittrick: Well, the check's paid. I'm all yours tonight. What do you want to do?
Bonnie: This.


Ben McKittrick: What's wrong?
Bonnie: Nothing. Sorry. I just should have waited until the end of the night to do that.
Ben McKittrick: I didn't mind.
Bonnie:  You know, I'm starting to get tired.
Ben McKittrick: Do you want go?
Bonnie: I was going to say let's have some more coffee, get a caffeine buzz, and, I don't know, go out and do something crazy.
Ben McKittrick: Hmm, like what?
Bonnie: Like anything.
Ben McKittrick: Okay.
Bonnie: I'm going to run to the restroom.
Ben McKittrick: Okay.
Bonnie: All right.

Stefan: What?
Elena: Not many girls can say they've done this.


Elena: Is that it?


Damon: Well, what do you know?


Damon: This is an interesting turn of events.
Stefan: I can't let you bring her back. I'm sorry.
Damon: So am I. For thinking for even a second that I could trust you.
Stefan: Oh. You're not capable of trust. The fact that you're here means that you read the journal and you were planning on doing this yourself.
Damon: Of course I was going to do it by myself, because the only one I can count on is me! You made sure of that many years ago, Stefan. But you...


Damon: You had me fooled.


Damon: So what are you going to do now? Because if you try and destroy that, I'll rip her heart out.
Stefan: You won't kill her.


Damon: I can do one better.


Damon: Give me the book, Stefan, or I'm snapping her neck. And you and I will have a vampire girlfriend.
Stefan: Let her go first.


Damon: The book!
Stefan: I'm not going to give this to you until she is standing next to me.
Damon: Problem is, I no longer trust that you'll give it back!
Stefan: You just did the one thing that ensures that I will.


Stefan: Okay.


Mystic Falls 1864


First man: Make sure the two of you stick together!
Second man: Go and check those woods over there!

Damon: Then let me be killed!

Elena: Aspirin must be downstairs. Is my head supposed to hurt like this?
Stefan: Oh, you'll be fine. That was just a small amount of blood. It should pass out of your system by tomorrow.


Elena: Are you OK?
Stefan: Damon was right. This is, uh...this is my fault.
Mystic Falls 1864


Stefan: Damon! Damon! Stop, stop. I'll help you. We'll get her back.


Damon: Help me!? Don't you think that you've done enough? You promised you wouldn't tell him!
Stefan: I didn't think this would happen.


Damon: You did this. This is your fault.


Gilbert Residence


Stefan: I put my faith in my father, but Damon put his faith in me, and I destroyed that. This is my fault.


Elena: You didn't do anything wrong. Don't forget that.
Stefan: Okay.


Stefan: I'm going to get you that aspirin.
Elena: Okay.


Jenna: You know you're not staying the night, right?


Stefan: We're just going to hang out for a little while.
Jenna: You're lucky I like you. Keep the door open.
Stefan: You got it. Hey, do you have any aspirin?
Jenna: Yeah.


Jeremy: Oh, hey, Stefan.  Where'd she go?
Jenna: She went to the bathroom.
Stefan: Where'd who go?
Jenna: He has a friend over.
Jeremy: Anna.

Johnathan: You!

Pearl: I beg you!
Johnathan: I've got another one over here!


Anna: Mother!

Ben McKittrick: I wouldn't.


Ben McKittrick: Don't try to escape. Don't even move. Do you understand?
Elena: I understand.


Anna: Seriously?!
Ben McKittrick: I told her not to move! I did that eye thing that you taught me!
Anna: And forgot the lesson about vervain! She dates a vampire, Ben. Duh!


Elena: Who are you? What do you want?
Anna: Does it matter?


Elena: Bonnie?  Oh my god!


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: Anna took Elena.
Damon: Yeah, I got that from your 600 voice mails.


Stefan: Damon, all night long, every single street in town, I've been searching. What if your blood hasn't passed out of her system?
Damon: Well, then at least you know you'll see her again.
Stefan: Please.  What do you know? You were with Anna, you must know where's she living. Just tell me where I can find her.
Damon:  Nope. You can go. Really.
Stefan: You know, all I can remember is hating you. There might have been a time when that was different, but your choices have erased anything good about you.  But see, I also know you have just as much reason to hate me. This all began with me. Katherine got taken away from you because of me. And I'm sorry.
Damon: Apology accepted.
Stefan: So please, just tell me what you know.
Damon: Huh.
Stefan:  It's Elena, Damon. If you know something, tell me.


Damon: I mean this sincerely.  I hope Elena dies.

Elena: Bonnie?
Bonnie: Elena?
Elena: Oh, you're okay!
Bonnie: My head...
Elena: Come here.


Bonnie: Oh my god! Ben is a-!
Elena: Shhhh.


Elena: They can hear.


Bonnie: I'm so stupid!
Elena: No, he had all of us fooled!
Bonnie: What's going on? Why are we here?
Elena: It must have something to do with the tomb and Emily's spell book.
Bonnie: Spell book?
Elena: Damon said it could be used to open the tomb.
Bonnie: Why didn't I know about any of this?
Elena: I was trying to keep you out of it, hoping it would never come to this.
Bonnie: Come to what?
Elena: They need a witch to break the spell and let the vampires out.
Bonnie: No way!
Elena: I know.


Bonnie: You're wasting your time. I'm not gonna help you.


Ben McKittrick: That's why she's here. Motivation for you to behave. You know, you shouldn't be so desperate. You made it too easy.


Ben McKittrick: She wants to talk to you.


Anna: Well, well. Elena Gilbert. You really are Katherine's doppelganger. You must have the Salvatore boys reeling.
Elena: Who are you?
Anna: I'm Anna. Your brother may have mentioned me.  I mean, we're like, practically dating.

Tyler: Ten kegs? You know how much damage we could do with ten kegs? Duke's got it all hooked up.
Matt: Duke's a douche.
Tyler: Yeah, a douche with ten kegs. Aka, my new best friend.


Tyler: What's the problem, Gilbert?
Jeremy: Don't have one, Lockwood.
Tyler: Yeah, I didn't think so.
Matt: Do you ever get bored of it?
Tyler: Of what?
Matt: Yourself.


Tyler: Keep laughing, buddy.


Caroline: Hey, Jeremy. Where is Elena? I've been texting her and Bonnie all day about Duke's party.
Jeremy: Uh, she went somewhere with Stefan.
Caroline:  I am so not going to be one of those girls who disappears just because she has a new boyfriend.
Jeremy: Who is Duke?
Caroline: Some guy that graduated a couple of years ago. And he throws a party every time he comes home from Duke.
Jeremy: Wait, Duke goes to Duke?
Caroline: His real name's Bob or something.  He's a total ass. But he buys the beer. You know, you should come.
Jeremy: Uh, yeah, I - I don't think so.
Caroline: No, seriously. Everyone goes. Even quiet loner little brothers.  Think about it.


Caroline: Hey!
Matt: Hey.
Caroline: So, I have a speech. It is fully scripted and well-rehearsed. Are you ready for it?
Matt: You wrote a speech?
Caroline: Yes. It's a You kissed me and I don't want things to be weird speech. It's preemptive.
Matt:  Preemptive?
Caroline: Yeah, you know, in case you were having second thoughts or regrets, or were, like, ooged out-
Matt: Ooged, huh?
Caroline: Can I just get on with the speech part?
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Caroline: So I know that you don't think that this is going to work out between us. I just want to let you know that right here and right now, I'm offering you an out. Like an escape clause.
Matt: Why are you giving me an escape clause?
Caroline: I don't wanna make assumptions about what it is we're doing here.
Matt: Got it.
Caroline: So, if you would like to exercise it, just let me know.

Grams: Yes?
Damon: Hi there. I'm, uh, looking for Bonnie.
Grams: She's not here.
Damon: Oh, well do you know when she-
Grams: Never.
Damon:  You have quite an opinion for someone who doesn't know me.
Grams: You got some nerve knocking on a Bennett witch's door and asking her for anything.
Damon: What'd I do?
Grams: Spirits talk, Mr. Salvatore, and so does my granddaughter. You are no friend to us. Now get off my porch.


Damon: Step outside and say that.


Grams: I am not Bonnie. You don't wanna mess with me.


Motel Room


Elena: Bonnie's not gonna open the tomb.
Anna: Oh, I think she will.
Elena: Do you really want Katherine out that bad?


Anna: Trust me. No one I know wants to see that girl again. Except Damon, the lovestruck idiot.
Elena: Then what is it? Or who is it?
Anna: My mother's in there.  Katherine couldn't help herself. She just had to toy around with both of the Salvatore brothers. And when she got caught, so did my mother. I watched Johnathan Gilbert take her away.
Elena:  I'm sorry.
Anna: You really mean that, don't you?  Yeah, I think we'll skip the dead mom bonding so you can start serving a purpose.
Elena: Which is what?
Anna: Leverage. This belong to you?


Anna: Ah-ah!


Stefan: Elena? Are you okay?
Anna: She's fine. For now. Tell me you have the grimoire and she'll stay fine.


Stefan: I can get it.
Anna: Which means your brother has it. And I have the witch. So one of you had better meet me in the very public town square in 30 minutes so we can safely discuss how fun it's gonna be to work together.


Damon: Go ahead. Grovel again. Oh, wait no...I don't care.




Anna: I'm leaving.


Anna: Keep them buttoned down. Compulsion won't work. Just use violence.
Ben McKittrick: Right. I got that.


Ben McKittrick: Sit. Behave.  So you're the key to this. Literally. The one who opens the door. Tell me, how long have you been a witch?
Elena: Is there anything to drink here?


Ben McKittrick: Are you offering? There's water on the night stand.


Bonnie: Hey. Can I have a sip?


Ben McKittrick: Come back in! Shut the door!


Bonnie: Don't hurt her!
Ben McKittrick: Don't make me!


Ben McKittrick: Lock it!

Jeremy: Anna! Hey-uh, what happened to you last night?
Anna: Sorry, I had to leave. I told your sister to tell you.
Jeremy: I haven't seen her.
Anna: Well, I gotta run, so-


Jeremy: Hey, do you wanna go to a party tonight?
Anna: Go to what?
Jeremy: Oh, the guy who's throwing it is a total douche, but it's supposed to be fun. I figured, you know, safety in numbers.
Anna:  So, you're finally ready to go out with me, are you?
Jeremy: It's been a while since I've been to a party, and I kind of want to get back out there. And not be such a - a loner. And, uh, I like you. You're fun, and you're also kind of strange and lurky but, uh, I guess I like that, too. So, yeah, you should come to the party. With me. It's in the woods by that old cemetery.
Anna: Oh. It's there, huh? That sounds cool. Uh, I'll meet you.
Jeremy: Oh. Okay! Great.


Jeremy: Cool.
Anna: Okay.


Damon: Got a hot date or are you just plan on nabbing the entire Gilbert family?
Anna: A party, right next to the old cemetery. Isn't that nice of them? Lots of warm bodies for starving vampires.
Damon: I told you. I work alone.
Anna: Yeah, so do I. But your minus a witch and I'm minus a spell book. So what do you say?
Damon: Stefan will come after you, you know that. For messing with Elena.
Anna: Then he won't be to happy if I kill her when I don't get what I want.


Damon: When do you want to do this?


Anna: God, it's like 1864 all over again. You Salvatores are truly pathetic when it comes to women. Tonight. After sundown. Meet at the church.

Ben McKittrick: Witches don't have eternal life, right? So you guys can die.
Bonnie: Yep. We can die.
Ben McKittrick: Ah. That sucks.


Elena: Stefan!


Stefan: Let's get outside!


Stefan: When the sun goes down, leave town. If I ever see you again, I will kill you.

Bonnie: How did you know where we were?
Grams: Many things can fuel a witches power. Worry. Anger. After Stefan told me they had taken you, I had a lot of both. Simple locater spell was easy after that.
Bonnie: I'm sorry. About all of this.
Grams:  Not as sorry as they're gonna be.


Elena: So what do we do now?
Stefan: Well, for now, you need to stay here.
Grams: A prisoner, in my own home? I don't think so.
Stefan: I can't protect you if you leave the house.
Grams: We'll protect ourselves.
Elena: We need to let him have Katherine back. He's not going to stop until he gets her. If we help him, maybe that ends it.
Bonnie: No! He doesn't deserve to get what he wants.
Elena: What other choice do we have?


Grams: Witches being pulled down by vampire problems. As much as we tried to do to stay out of it. I'll open the tomb. You get your brother's girl and destroy the rest with fire. Then this will be all over.
Stefan: We still have to get Damon to agree.
Elena: He already agreed once.
Stefan: Yeah, and then we double crossed him. So now he's angry.
Elena: He's hurt. There's a difference. I think I know what I have to do.

Anna: You've got to be kidding me.


Ben McKittrick: It was Stefan. There was nothing I could --


Anna: Shut up! Stop talking.  Without the witch, we don't have Damon or the grimoire. Damon's not gonna stop. He'll find a way in. And we're gonna be there when he does.

Damon: I doubt that.


Elena: I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry we got the grimoire without you last night, because I'm not really.
Damon: Well, at least you're honest.
Elena: I was protecting the people I love, Damon. But so were you, in your own, twisted way. And as hard as it is to figure, we're all on the same side, after the same thing.


Damon: Not interested.


Elena: Yes you are, because you were willing to work with us yesterday.
Damon:  Fool me once, shame on you.
Elena: Okay, when we were in Atlanta, why didn't you use your compulsion on me?


Damon: Who's to say I didn't?
Elena: You didn't. I know you didn't. But you could have. You and I...we have something. An understanding. And I know that my betrayal hurt you, different from how it is with you and Stefan, but I'm promising you this now, I will help you get Katherine back.
Damon:  I wish I could believe you.


Elena: Ask me if I'm lying now.


Damon: You know Anna won't stop, by the way, no matter what I do.
Elena: Then we'll deal with it.


Damon: I didn't compel you in Atlanta because we were having fun. I wanted it to be real. I'm trusting you. Don't make me regret it.


The Woods


Elena: The Duke party. I forgot. I hope they stay clear of the church.
Damon: Your hope, not mine.


Matt: Elena, hey!
Caroline: Elena! Oh my God, where have you been?


Damon: Long story, no time to tell it.
Caroline: I wasn't talking to you.
Damon: Sure you were.
Matt: We haven't met. I'm Matt.


Damon: Matt, there's a reason we haven't met. You and I are going that way.


Elena: Ah, I'm sorry, guys.




Stefan: Cleared the debris away. Set the torches like you asked. We can get down now.


Bonnie: What is that?
Stefan: It's everything I need to destroy them.


Grams: Are you sure that Damon will come back with her?


Damon: Brother. Witches.


Stefan: Everything okay?
Elena: I just want to get this over with. Are we ready?
Bonnie: I guess so.


Tyler: Done!


Tyler: I'll be right back.  Hey man, uh, you got any weed?
Jeremy: Wait, you're kidding me, right? You act like a total dick every time we cross paths, and - and now you wanna party with me?
Tyler: Lighten up, Gilbert. I'm just asking you a question.
Jeremy: Look, I don't get you man.
Tyler: It's a party. You're a partyer. There's no need to psychoanalyze it.
Jeremy: I don't party anymore and even if I did, it wouldn't be with you.


Tyler: No problem. Carry on just standing there. By yourself. All alone. The enemy of fun. Do you even have any friends?


Jeremy: Thank God.
Anna: Weird hello but, okay. What's the matter?
Jeremy: Uh, nothing. Nothing, just....


Jeremy: It's- nothing.
Anna: Come on, let's walk.


Church Ruins


Grams: Air. Earth. Fire.
Bonnie: Water.


Elena: That's it? Just water from the tap?
Grams: As opposed to what?
Elena: I just figured maybe it would have to be blessed or mystical or something.


Stefan: What's that?
Damon: It's for Katherine. Gotta have something to get her going. Unless your girl's offering a vein to tap.  Admit it - you can't wait to get rid of me.
Stefan:  I can't wait to get rid of you.
Damon: Hmm.


Bonnie: We're ready.
Woods


Anna: This place is wild.
Jeremy: You kinda like dead people, huh?
Anna: I'm strange, remember? You okay?
Jeremy: Uh, yeah. Yeah. This place makes me think about someone.
Anna: A dead someone?
Jeremy: No, no, just...someone I used to know. So, uh, hey,  we made it all of what, 37 minutes, in that party?
Anna:  Not your scene?


Jeremy: I'm not really sure what my scene is anymore. So what do you say? You, uh, you wanna be part of my non-scene?
Anna: I would happily be a part of your non-scene, except, uh, I'm leaving.
Jeremy: Wait, what?
Anna: Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.
Jeremy: Oh. Uh- that's--that's a bummer.
Anna: Yeah?
Jeremy: Well, yeah.
Anna: So, guess this is goodbye.
Jeremy: I guess it is.


Jeremy: Anna, your face!


Anna: It's nothing.
Jeremy: It didn't look like nothing.


Anna:  You didn't have to hit him that hard.
Ben McKittrick: Yes, I did.
Anna: Grab him and lets go. I'm taking him to meet my mother.


Tyler: Swoop!


Matt: Hey!
Tyler: Aah. Where's your date?
Matt: Who knows?
Tyler: Aww, is the honeymoon over already?
Matt: Maybe.
Tyler: After all that grief you gave me about liking her. I figured it would have lasted longer than five minutes.
Matt: Look, I just -- I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing. She -- she seems like she might be a little clingy.
Tyler: Well, good. I need my boy single anyway.  Ohh, incoming.


Caroline: Hey! There you are.
Matt: Here I am.
Tyler: Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough. So I'm just gonna go get another beer.


Caroline: So...
Matt: So.
Caroline: I have another speech.
Matt: Okay.
Caroline: The hand thing, with Elena, it was lame. Well, I was lame. And, hey, your feelings for Elena aside, Damon was there, and he was always such a jerk to me. And I wanted to show off that I was with a good guy. So, anyway, I was lame. So, forgiven?
Matt: Yeah, of course. Yeah.


Church Ruins


Damon: What are they saying?
Stefan: Sounds Latin.
Elena: I don't think it's Latin.


Elena: What's happening?


Bonnie: It worked!
Grams: Of course it worked.
Damon:  We have some fires to build.
Stefan:  I'm gonna go get the gasoline, I'll be right back.


Damon: You ready?
Elena: What?
Damon:  You think I'm gonna go in there by myself so you can seal me in?


Grams: Don't take her in. I'll bring the walls down.
Damon: You'll bring the walls down if I don't. You think I trust you?
Grams: As much as I trust you.
Elena: Enough. Both of you. Look, he needs leverage. He needs to know that you're not going to shut the door when he gets inside. I get it. I'll go.


Damon: May I?




Ben McKittrick: Dark down there?


Stefan: Thought I told you to leave.
Ben McKittrick: I considered it. Then I thought, screw you.
Anna: Hey, hero.  I'm going down there to get my mother.
Stefan: I can't let you do that.
Anna: Well, Ben's about to make a main course out of Elena's little brother. So, you can stop me or him. Your choice.




Elena: What is that?!
Damon: They can sense you. Now, where is she?


Elena: Damon!


Bonnie: Hey, you're not going in there!
Anna: You think you can stop me?
Grams: Bonnie...


Bonnie: Why did you let her go in?
Grams: Because she isn't coming out, baby. None of them are.


Stefan: Do you really think that she cares about you? Hm? You're disposable.
Ben McKittrick: I don't care. She already gave me what I want.
Stefan: Are you going to say eternal life? You really that stupid?


Ben McKittrick: You know, I've heard about you. You don't feed. You're not strong enough to beat me.


Ben McKittrick: Is that all you got?
Stefan: No. I got this.




Elena: Damon?  Damon!




Stefan: Where's Elena?
Bonnie: Damon took her inside.
Stefan: What?!


Grams: Stefan! If you go in there, you won't come out.
Stefan: What did you do?
Grams: Opening the door didn't remove the seal, it just opened the door.
Stefan: What's the seal?
Grams: Some seals keep vampires from entering. This one keeps them from coming out.
Stefan: Elena's human. She can leave. Anna and Katherine can't. Damon can't. You were never planning on breaking the spell, were you?
Grams: I told you. I will protect my own. Elena can get out. That's all that matters.


Anna: You must have a taste for it. You scream and shriek and even bother to escape, but then you just come right back to it.


Anna: Mother! Mother. Your boyfriend did this, you know.
Elena: His father did.


Anna: And Johnathan Gilbert. I made a choice a long time ago that it would be Gilbert blood that brought her back to life. I had Jeremy all ready to go but....




Bonnie: Stefan!  You can't just leave him in there, Grams!
Grams: He made his choice!
Bonnie: No. Here.  Just show me what to do. I'll do it.
Grams: We are not strong enough. Even if we were able to bring the seal down, there's no guarantee that we could get it back up again.
Bonnie: You said it yourself, many things can fuel a witches power. Help me or I'll do it alone.


Elena: No, please don't!
Anna:   I'm gonna get you out.


Stefan: Let her go!


Anna: No!


Stefan: Go. Go. I'm right behind you.


Pearl: Anna.


Pearl: Annabelle.


Bonnie: Elena, Stefan...
Elena: He's right behind me.


Elena: Stefan, what are you doing?
Bonnie: It's gonna be okay. We'll fix it.
Elena: What is it?
Stefan: I can't.
Elena: Can't? Can't what?
Bonnie: The spell's still up. We can't get them out yet.
Elena: You went in there not knowing if you could come back out?


Elena: Oh, my God.
Stefan: I heard you scream.
Elena: We can't leave him in there. We promised him. Both of us.
Stefan: I know.
Grams: Even if we're able to break through the seal, we won't be able to hold it for long.




Damon: She's not here.


Stefan: Damon.
Damon: She's not here.
Stefan: What?


Damon: She's not here!




Elena: I think it's working.


Anna: I just wanted my mother back. Jeremy's fine. He's outside. I won't touch him.


Grams: Bonnie, keep going!  They better hurry.
Elena: Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!


Stefan: Damon, we need to get out of here.
Damon: It doesn't make sense. They locked her inside.
Stefan: If we don't leave now, we're not getting out.
Damon: How could she not be in here?
Stefan: It's not worth spending all of eternity down here. She's not worth it!
Damon: No!


Elena: Damon! Please.




Bonnie: Oh my God. I can't!
Grams: Yes, you can.




Matt: Is this for real?
Caroline: Is what for real?
Matt: You being all cool and honest and open?


Caroline: Speech number three? I want this to work. And I'm scared that you're gonna change your mind and you're not gonna want it. I don't want to mess it up.
Matt: I don't want to mess it up either.




Stefan: He's okay.


Stefan: He's all right.


Elena: I'm sorry.
Sheila's Residence


Bonnie: Hey, let me help you.
Grams: Oh, I'm fine. You don't need to coddle me, baby.
Bonnie: It was a big spell, Grams. I could tell it took a lot out of you.
Grams: I'll be fine.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: How's your head?
Jeremy: Uh- it's alright. I just....I wish I knew how I passed out. I didn't drink that much, I swear.
Elena: And you don't remember anything?
Jeremy: The whole things pretty cloudy. I just...I know how this looks. I'm -- I'm sorry.
Elena: No, Jeremy, don't be sorry. You didn't do anything, okay?
Jeremy: Yeah, okay.
Elena: I've got to head on over to Bonnie's for a little bit, but is there anything that you need?
Jeremy: No, I'm just...I'm gonna crash.
Elena: Okay, well, Jenna's here and I'll be back soon.


Motel Room


Damon: You knew Katherine wasn't in there.
Anna: You wouldn't have helped me.


Anna: No! No!
Damon: Why do you get a happy ending?


Anna: Damon, please! You wouldn't have helped me, you know you wouldn't have!


Damon: Why do you get it and I don't?
Pearl: The guard. The one at the church. The one who locked us in. She promised to turn him. He was obsessed with her. She had him under her spell, like everybody else. He let her go.


Anna: Last I saw her was Chicago, 1983. She knew where you were Damon. She didn't care.


Anna: Sorry.


Sheila's Residence


Elena: I just got to Bonnie's.
Stefan: Everything alright?
Elena: Yeah. How's Damon? Is he gonna be okay?
Stefan: I don't know. Can I call you later?
Elena: Yeah, of course.

Bonnie: Grams?


Bonnie: Grams! Grams, wake up! Grams! Grams!  Elena!


Bonnie: Help! Wake up! She's not breathing! She's just not breathing! Please, wake up!


Bonnie: I'm gonna fix it! It's okay, I can fix this!
Elena: Yes, I need an ambulance to Oak Street. It's an emergency, quick.


Elena: Bonnie....Bonnie.
Bonnie: No! No! I can fix it! Grams, I can fix this!
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie.

Man: Jeez! You scared me.
Harper: Do you know what day it is?
Man: Saturday.
Harper: And what year?
Man: It's 2010. Are you OK?
Harper: Thank you.
Man: Wait, what's your name?
Harper: It's Harper, sir.


Man: How did you get out here? And why are you dressed like that?
Harper: You seem like a very nice person. I'm sorry.
Man: Sorry for what?






Gilbert Residence


Elena: Hey, Bonnie, it's me just checking in, seeing how you're doing. We miss you here. Don't let your aunt drive you too crazy.


Elena: Come home soon. Love you. 
Jenna: What are you doing out here? It's cold.
Elena: Thinking, writing. The, uh, funeral for Bonnie's grandma, it brought back a lot about mom and dad. I was wondering...you said that you would do some digging about them, the adoption.
Jenna: Right.
Elena: So did you? Dig?
Jenna: Come on inside.


Jenna: Your dad kept everything from his medical practice, records, logs, old appointment books.  I found an entry from the night you were born. Patient and a birth date. Isobel Peterson.
Elena: Do you think that's her real name?
Jenna: Pregnant teenage runaway? Probably not. First name, maybe. But where'd she get Peterson? Classmate? Best friend? So I binged it.  I searched for all the Petersons in this area born the same year as Isobel, found 3--2 men and a woman, Trudie, who lived in Grove Hill, Virginia.
Elena: That's not far from here.
Jenna: Well, watch this.


Elena: Isobel.  She was a cheerleader.
Jenna: Trudie still lives there.  This is her address.
Elena: What about Isobel?
Jenna: I couldn't find anything about her.  Listen. There's something else. Mr. Saltzman, Ric, his wife was from around here, and her name was also Isobel.
Elena: Wait. Was, as in...
Jenna: She died.


Stefan: Alaric's wife might have been your mother?
Elena:   I have the address for her friend Trudie.
Stefan: You wanna talk to her.
Elena: I don't know. I...I--I don't know. If it's true and they are the same person, that means that my birth mother is dead, and I don't know if I could handle that.
Stefan: Elena, did Jenna tell you anything about Alaric's wife? How she died?
Elena: Just that she was killed and the case was never solved.

Elena: You knew that already?
Stefan: The night at the school when he attacked me, he told me some things about her death.
Elena: Well, 
Stefan: No, no.  It's not possible. The coincidence is, it's too much. Now, listen, if you do decide to go talk to Isobel's friend, I'll go with you. Okay?
Elena: I just don't know what I'm gonna do yet.


Stefan: I should get going. I gotta go deal with Damon.
Elena: How's he doing?
Stefan: He's dealing in his own way.
Salvatore Boarding House


Girl: How do I taste?
Damon:  Oh, so much better than your friends. But shh. Don't tell them. They might get jealous.


Damon: No! Buzzkill Bob.


Damon: Greetings.
Stefan: Can we talk?
Damon: Yeah.
Stefan: Without the Tri-Delts.
Damon: Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of them. They're really good at keeping secrets.


Damon: You're worried about me. That's nice. Don't be. There's no need. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? I spent the last 145 years with one goal: get in that tomb. I succeeded. Granted, Katherine wasn't in there to be rescued, but why dwell? You know, it's so liberating not having a master plan, because I can do whatever the hell I want.
Stefan: That's kind of what I'm afraid of.
Damon: Relax. I haven't killed anyone in--  too long.
Stefan: Those girls?
Damon: Will end up in their dorm with headaches, think they blacked out. Business as usual. Predictable you didn't pull me over here for a pep talk. So drink up.  Spill it, brother.


Stefan: There was a woman you may have known a few years back named Isobel in North Carolina at Duke.
Damon: You wanna discuss the women in my past right now? Seriously?
Stefan: You killed her.
Damon: What's your point?
Stefan: I just, just wanna know if you remember anything about her.
Damon: Oh, it's like a needle in a haystack, Stefan.
Stefan: Well, think hard. It's important.


Damon: Nothing is important, not anymore.


Damon: Great chat. I have to go and exploit some women in the name of grief, which I'm sure you understand. TTFN, said the Tri-Delt. Heh.


Donovan Residence


Matt: What?
Caroline: This is boring. I'm bored.
Matt: Wow.
Caroline: But we have this entire house to ourselves. I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad.
Matt: And...
Caroline: So shouldn't we do something a little bit more bachelor-paddy?
Matt: What? Something like this?


Caroline: Something like that.


Matt: I don't know. This is a pretty good show.


Caroline: Seriously?


Kelly: Oh, god.


Kelly: Not on my couch.
Matt: Mom! Hey.


Mystic Grill


Alaric: I don't know. It's just weird, you know, me being raffled off like a Disney Cruise.
Jenna: In this town, fundraising is like indentured servitude. You don't have a choice. Besides, you're a bachelor, and you're eligible, so there you go.


Alaric: Here. Let me help you with this.


Jenna: Oh, god. I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
Alaric: What?
Jenna: I am totally going to ruin this moment, but I--I have to tell you. Elena recently found out she was adopted, and she's been looking for her birth mother...whose name was Isobel.
Alaric: Isobel? Like my wife?


Alaric: Isobel never had a baby.
Jenna: Are you sure? Not before you were together?
Alaric: Nope. No way.


Jenna: This is Elena's birth mother.


Alaric: Ah, she, uh, she never told me. I, uh, I'm gonna go. Yeah, I'm gonna, gonna go.


Trudie's Residence


Elena: Trudie? Tru-trudie Peterson?
Trudie: Yes?
Elena: Uh, my name is Elena Gilbert. I wanted to talk to you about Isobel Flemming.
Trudie: Well, I haven't heard that name in years. How do you know her?
Elena: I think that, um, well...do you know if she had a baby that she gave up for adoption?
Trudie: My god. You're her daughter.  I was just gonna make some tea. Would you like some?
Elena: Sure.
Trudie: Uh, the kitchen's this way.




Elena: I wasn't gonna come. I didn't think I was, but I was driving, and I hit this stoplight, and it made me think about when I was learning how to drive and then my mom would always warn me about this blind turn on the left-hand side, and then I was thinking about my mom, and, I had your address. I'm sorry for barging in.
Trudie: It's no problem. Um, just a surprise, though.


Trudie: I haven't thought about Isobel in years.
Elena: When was the last time you saw her?
Trudie: About 17 years ago, when she left to go have you. We kept in touch for a while, but, well, you know, people drift apart.
Elena: And you don't know where she ended up?
Trudie: She was in Florida for a while. She was on her own. I know it wasn't easy.
Elena: Do you have any idea who my father is?
Trudie: I could never get her to fess up. Anyway, she finally pulled it together, got into college on a scholarship.
Elena: Where did she go?
Trudie: Somewhere in North Carolina. Duke, I think.Smart girl, smart school.


Trudie: Let me just grab that.


Donovan Residence


Matt: So, it's been a few months. Where've you been?
Kelly: Ah, you know, here and there. Never one place too long. You know Pete.
Matt: No, actually, I don't. Because you never brought him around.


Kelly: So blonde's the new flavor of the month, huh? So sorry I scared her off.
Matt: She's not a flavor, Mom. I like her.
Kelly: So she's the one?
Matt: No, probably not, but maybe.


Kelly: Mattie, seriously, Lezzie Forbes' daughter? Eck.
Matt: Mom, seriously, knock it off.
Kelly: Ice, please?


Matt: So, uh, you heard from Vic?


Kelly: No, but don't worry. She'll come home eventually when she needs something. I played that game.
Matt: Are you playing it now?
Kelly: No.
Matt: Then what are you doin' home?
Kelly: Are you trying to say I need a reason to come back? Sit down. Eat with me.


Kelly: Tell me everything I've missed, hmm.
Town Square


Alaric: Thanks for meeting me. Something's come up.
Stefan: Jenna told you.
Alaric: Yeah.
Stefan: So it's true. Your wife Isobel was Elena's birth mother.
Alaric: What does Elena know?
Stefan:  About your wife?
Alaric: About everything. About you, your brother.
Stefan: She knows what I am, and she knows that you know about the vampires.
Alaric: Does she know about Damon and Isobel?
Stefan: No. I couldn't tell her, not until I was sure.
Alaric: You said you'd help me.
Stefan: I asked Damon without saying too much. He doesn't remember.
Alaric: Ask him again.
Stefan: Damon is not stable right now.
Alaric: You know, he murdered my wife, or at the very least made a meal out of her. When has he been stable?
Stefan: I'm telling you not to push this.
Alaric: Give me a reason not to.
Stefan: Your survival. How's that for a reason? I'll handle it, but for now, I need you to let it go.
Alaric: Is that what you'll tell Elena? Let it go?


Stefan:  Leave Elena out of this.
Alaric: I need to know what happened. I think you would, too.


Stefan: I need something more than just your wife's name. A picture, something I could show Damon.


Flashback


Alaric: Is.
Isobel: Just a few more minutes.
Alaric: Can't you, uh, can't you finish this in the morning?


Isobel: But I like working at night.
Alaric: Yeah, see, I like sleeping at night. With you.


Alaric: Okay, I'll bite. What is it, thesis stuff?


Alaric: Look, baby, I'm in a three-way here with you and your computer, the least you can do is let me know what you're up to.


Isobel: I was doing research, and I dug up all this stuff about this small town in Virginia near where I grew up. It's isolated, out of the way, and quiet. And every now and then, people die mysteriously, and they say that it's animal attacks. Except, these bodies are drained of blood.


Isobel: It's vampires. It has to be.
Alaric: Okay. I'll get my garlic and holy water, and then maybe, just maybe...


Isobel: No.


Alaric: We can get some sleep. Come here.
Isobel: No.


Alaric: Look, this is why I love you, because you believe in all of this stuff. So much so that you're making a degree out of it. You're like Mulder, except hotter and a girl.


Isobel: This is not a joke, Ric. You think that this is cute, but I'm gonna prove it.


Isobel: And Mulder was right in the end.
Trudie's Residence


Trudie: Ah. They came to the games for us.The football team hadn't won in years. We were the stars. Well, Izzie was. But I was a damn good backup.
Elena:  Heh. This is great. Thank you.
Trudie: You're welcome.  You haven't touched your tea.
Elena: Oh. Yeah.


Elena: What is this?
Trudie: Oh, it's just some herbal mixture.
Elena: Vervain?


Elena: You know.
Trudie: Know what?
Elena: You didn't invite me in, and you're serving vervain tea. You know.


Trudie: I think that you should probably leave.


Elena: Wait. What are you not telling me?
Trudie: Please leave. Now!


Mystic Grill


Damon: Bourbon.


Damon: Behold the teacher. Don't you have some papers to grade?
Alaric: It's, uh, more fun with a buzz.
Damon: Well, most things in life are. Sober's depressing.
Alaric: You don't strike me as somebody who gets depressed.
Damon: You say that like you know me.
Alaric: Nope. Just a hunch.


Alaric: You have a good afternoon.
Damon: Not likely.


Sheriff Forbes: Daytime drinking, huh?
Damon: It's all the rage.
Sheriff Forbes: Listen, I need a favor.
Damon: You ever been in love?
Sheriff Forbes: Excuse me?
Damon: Have you ever been so bent on someone, just to have your heart ripped out by them?
Sheriff Forbes: You forget I was married.
Damon: Right. Gay husband.  She'll have what I'm having.


Damon:  Sit down.


Sheriff Forbes: There's a fundraiser here tonight that the Founder's Council is throwing. The town's most eligible bachelors get raffled off for dates, and, well, we're short a bachelor.
Damon: Is this what you do when there's no, um... Vampires? Organize bachelor raffles?


Sheriff Forbes: Oh, trust me. At this point, I miss the vampires. Look, you're a hero to this town, Damon. I know most people don't know it, but you are, and you're single and a catch. Oh, come on, help me out. Carol Lockwood won't let me live it down if I come up empty-handed.
Damon: You know, a room full of women clamoring to win a date with me. Sounds tasty.
Sheriff Forbes:  Thank you.
Damon: One thing. Can you get information on someone for me? Alaric Saltzman, the history teacher. There's just something a little off about him, and I just -- I just wanna make sure that the high school did their homework on this guy.


Sheriff Forbes: You got it.
Damon: Thanks.


Trudie's Residence


Trudie: May I help you?
Man: Thank you for the text.


Trudie: You're welcome. I didn't tell her anything. I--I kept my promise.
Man: Good.
Trudie: The girl, though, she, she knew something.
Man: That won't be a problem. She won't get any closer to the truth.
Trudie: Good. So I'm done?
Man: Yes. You're done.


Trudie: No, I won't invite you in! You can't come in!
Man: I'm not a vampire, so, yes, I can.


Trudie: I don't understand. I did what you told me. I did my part!
Man: And now I have to do mine.

Elena: Stefan.
Damon: Better. Me.


Elena: You look, um...
Damon: Dashing? Gorgeous? Irresistible?


Elena: Wrecked. You look wrecked.
Damon: No reason why. Do you know that I am one of Mystic Falls' most eligible bachelors?
Elena: Huh.
Damon: Yep.
Elena: How are you doing?
Damon: Never better. Yep.


Damon: What can I do for you? I'm a barrel of favors today. It's my newfound purpose, how can I help people?
Elena: I'm just meeting Stefan. We're going to the fundraiser.


Damon: Help a guy out, will you? Can't get this.


Elena: So I found out who my birth mother is.
Damon: Eccch. Who cares?


Damon: She left you. She sucks.


Elena: Stefan. There you are.


Damon: Uhh. I need a bigger jacket. Wow. You know, an occasional sorority girl might, um, you know, help fill you out a little bit.


Elena: He's fine.
Stefan: He's Damon.
Elena: Maybe this heartache will be good for him. It'll remind him that he has one, even if it doesn't beat.
Stefan: Won't hold my breath.


Elena: So I went to see Trudie Peterson.


Elena: I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.
Stefan: How was it?
Elena: She has vervain. She knows about vampire stuff, and it can't be a coincidence.
Stefan: It isn't. This is Alaric's wife.


Elena: This is her. This is Isobel. He gave this to you?
Stefan: Everything he knows about vampires, he learned from her. He believes that she was killed by one.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: Listen, Elena, there's a lot about Isobel that Alaric can tell you, but I need you to hold off a little while before you talk to him.
Elena: Why?
Stefan: I know that it's a lot to ask of you, but will you do that for me?


Mystic Grill


Mrs Lockwood: Tickets for the raffle are now on sale. All proceeds benefit the annual Founder's Day celebration.


Jenna: That's a good look for you.
Alaric: What? Embarrassed and uncomfortable?
Jenna: Yep. That's-- that's the one.
Alaric: Hey, look, um, I'm, uh, sorry about earlier. It was just kind of a--a shock.
Jenna: No, I'm sorry for dropping it on you, but I felt like you should know.
Alaric: No, I get it.
Jenna: At some point, maybe you and Elena could talk. I'm sure she'd like to hear about Isobel, what she was like.
Alaric: Yeah.
Jenna: Uh...Or not. No pressure.
Alaric: I don't know if that's a--a great idea.  At least not, not for a while.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Where'd our girlfriend go?
Stefan: She's on her way to the Grill. I, uh, wanted to talk to you.


Stefan: This is the woman, Isobel, from North Carolina. Remember her now?
Damon: Who wants to know?
Stefan: I do.
Damon: Who else wants to know?
Stefan: Did you kill her?
Damon: Sorry. Don't know her.


Damon: Hey, are you coming? The Real Housewives of Mystic Falls await.
Mystic Grill


Caroline: He's already been hit on, like, 35 times. He's total cougar bait.
Elena: Impressive.
Matt: More like embarrassing


Caroline: Hi, Mrs. Donovan.


Kelly: Elena, honey.
Elena: Hi, Kelly.


Kelly: Long time, no see.
Elena: How are you doing?
Kelly: Oh, same old. Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.
Matt: Mom.
Kelly: Just kidding. Calm down. He found his rebound girl.


Kelly: Oh. Here you go, sweetheart. However many that'll buy.


Kelly: I just hope I don't get Bachelor 3. I dated him in high school. Not impressive.  In any way.


Kelly: Very exciting.




Damon: I've got the big date planned. It's a romantic dinner, secluded spot somewhere woodsy.
Mrs Lockwood: You're making me think I should buy a ticket.
Damon: Well, you are in charge. You could always rig it.


Damon: Mmm. Pardon me.


Sheriff Forbes: I ran the check on the history teacher. You want this before or after your big debut?
Damon: How's it look?


Sheriff Forbes: He checks out. Couple of speeding tickets. It's a rough story, though. Turns out his wife went missing a few years back in North Carolina.
Damon: North Carolina? She have a name?
Sheriff Forbes: Yeah. Isobel.


Damon: Isobel.




Mrs Lockwood: And what do you do, Bachelor Number 3?
Man: Yeah, I'm a plumber.
Mrs Lockwood: Well, isn't that wonderful? We could always use more plumbers. Moving on. Number 4, Alaric Saltzman. Wow. That's quite a mouthful. What do you do, Alaric?
Alaric: I'm a teacher at Mystic Falls High.
Mrs Lockwood: Oh, beauty and brains, ladies. This one's a keeper. What do you teach?
Alaric: History.
Mrs Lockwood: History. Oh, well, give us a fun fact about Mystic Falls, something crazy.


Alaric: Uh, well...


Mrs Lockwood: He's probably saving the best stories for his date.  And last, but not least, Damon Salvatore. We don't have much on you.


Damon: Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.
Mrs Lockwood: Do you have any hobbies, like to travel?
Damon: Oh, yeah. L.A., New York. Couple of years ago, I was in North Carolina. Near the Duke campus, actually. I think, I think Alaric went to school there. Didn't you, Ric?


Damon: Yeah, 'cause I-- I know your wife did.


Damon: I had a drink with her once. She was, she was a great girl. I ever tell you that? Cause she was -- Delicious. Mmm! Mmm mmm mmm.


Jenna: Are you okay?
Elena: I just need some air.




Stefan: Elena.
Elena: He killed her? Damon was the vampire that killed her?
Stefan: I don't know what happened. Alaric said that they never found the body.
Elena: Oh, my god. Stefan.
Stefan: I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But I just, I wanted to know more.
Elena: I was feeling sorry for him, hoping that this whole Katherine thing would change him. I'm so stupid.
Stefan: He doesn't know about the connection to you. I thought about confronting him, but he's already so on edge.
Elena: Why are you protecting him?
Stefan: Because you're not the only one hoping that he might actually change.


Elena: That man.


Elena: I saw that man outside of Trudie's.
Stefan: Get back inside. Come on.




Mrs Lockwood: And bachelor number 3 goes to 37458.
Kelly: That's me.


Mrs Lockwood: Ah. Kelly Donovan. Lovely.


Mrs Lockwood: You and the plumber should have so much fun.


Caroline: Congratulations, Mrs. Donovan.
Kelly: Okay, just stop. Stop trying so hard. This thing you're doing, this nice thing, it's fake. Like you. Like your mom. And for some reason, Matt fell for it, but that doesn't mean that I will. I don't like you, okay? So tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar.
Caroline: Okay.




Damon: Whoa. Easy there. Buy a ticket like everyone else.
Elena: Did you enjoy that? Rubbing it in to Alaric Saltzman?
Damon: What?
Elena: Just as I was starting to think that there was something redeemable about you.


Stefan: Elena.


Damon: Am I missing something here?
Elena: Did I forget to mention earlier when we were talking about my birth mother? The one that gave me up?
Damon: Mm-hm.
Elena: Her name was Isobel.


Elena: Go ahead. Reminisce about how you killed her.




Stefan: Come on. Let's get you home.


Man: I have a message for you.
Elena: What?
Stefan: Who are you?
Man: Stop looking.
Elena: Stop looking for what?
Man: She doesn't want to know you. She doesn't want to talk to you.
Elena: Isobel?
Man: You need to stop looking. Do you understand?
Elena: She's alive? Does that mean she's a--


Stefan: Elena, he's under compulsion.
Man: Do you understand?
Elena: Yes. I do.
Man: Good.


Man: I'm done now.




Stefan: Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on.




Mrs Lockwood: 37649.


Jenna: That's me.
Mrs Lockwood: Congratulations.


Mrs Lockwood: And Bachelor Number 5, Damon Salvatore.  37552.


Mrs Lockwood: Would you look at that? 37552. What are the chances? Me.  Where'd he go?
Alaric:  I'll call you later.


Flashback


Alaric: I think it's time to let this vampire crap go. I mean, the research, the trips, it's become an obsession.
Isobel: Well, this is important to me, Ric.
Alaric: Why? Why is it so important? Explain it to me. I mean, make me understand.


Alaric:  I mean, what's the point of this? You don't want kids. You're barely ever home. I just want us to be normal people.
Isobel: Maybe I don't want to. Maybe I want more.
Donovan Residence


Matt: Here we go. Home, sweet home.
Kelly: Wait. Why, why are we back here? I wasn't ready to leave.
Matt: Yeah, you were, mom.


Kelly: You're the best, Matty.
Matt: I know.
Kelly: I'm--I'm sorry...I was gone so long.
Matt: Why are you really home, mom?
Kelly: It's Pete. He's gone, and it's all my fault. I did it. I always do it.
Matt: No, you didn't, mom. It's not your fault.
Kelly: You're all I have left.  Please don't leave me.
Matt: I'm not going anywhere.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Are you really this stupid?


Damon: Guess so.


Damon: You gonna put down the stake?


Damon: Wow. That's courage.


Alaric: Where's Isobel? What have you done to my wife?
Damon: You want me to tell you I killed her? Would that make you happy? Because I think you know what happened.
Alaric: I saw you feeding on her.
Damon: Yeah, I did, and I wasn't lying. She was delicious.


Damon: Oh, come on. What do you think happened? Not an inkling? Never considered the possibility?


Damon: I turned her.
Alaric: Why?
Damon: She came to me. All pathetic, looking for vampires. There was something about her, something I liked. There was something special.
Alaric: You turned her because you liked her?
Damon: No, I slept with her because I liked her. I turned her because she begged me to. Yeah. But you knew that, too, didn't you? Hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home, wasn't happy with life in general, wasn't happy with you.


Damon: Ah, this is a shame. We're kindred spirits, abandoned by the women we love. Unrequited love sucks.


Damon: Sounds like I got a lung. Which means I get to sit here and watch you die.




Stefan: What happened? What did you do?
Damon: Do what? He attacked me.


Stefan: Damon.
Damon: All I did was tell him the truth. His wife didn't want him anymore. It's not my fault he couldn't handle it.
Stefan: Like you've been handling Katherine?
Damon: I'm handling it fine. You know what? Isobel came to me. She found me. And if she's related to Elena, that means she's related to Katherine. Maybe Katherine sent her to me.
Stefan: Stop it. You don't have to keep looking.
Damon: Can't be a coincidence Isobel sought me out. Uh-uh. Can't.  I'm assuming you'll take care of this.


Alaric: What happened? What's going on?
Stefan: You were just...Did Damon turn you?
Alaric: No. I - I went for him and then he, uh-- he stabbed me.
Stefan: No, no, no. You must have vampire blood in your system. Somebody slipped it to you.
Alaric:  No. It's, uh, it's something else.
Stefan: Then how?
Alaric: I, uh...


Alaric: Isobel.
Flashback


Alaric: Surprise gifts aren't fair. I always feel bad for not getting you something.
Isobel: Just open it.


Alaric: Oh, that's a giant piece of jewelry.


Isobel: I know. It's ridiculous. Just tell people it's a family heirloom. Nobody questions that.
Alaric: Where'd you get this?
Isobel: If I told you, you'd laugh at me. But promise me that you'll always wear it. It'll protect you from all the things that go bump in the night.
Alaric: A ring to ward off the demons, eh?
Isobel: Consider it a-- a token of my love, my affection, and if nothing else, an apology for being so crazy.
Alaric: Well, you were definitely crazy.


Isobel: I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed, and I'm a horrible wife. But you love me anyway.
Alaric: Yes, I do.
Salvatore Boarding House


Alaric: This ring protected me.
Stefan: That's impossible.
Alaric: I know.
Gilbert Residence


Isobel: Was there a problem? Did you find her? What's going on?
Elena: Isobel?


Miss Gibbons' Residence


Woman: Pearl, it's Harper.


Pearl: I'm glad you found us. Ms. Gibbons, this gentleman is a friend of mine.


Pearl: May he come in?
Miss Gibbons: Any friend of Pearl's is a friend of mine. Please do. Come in.
Pearl: Annabelle, close the door, please.


Miss Gibbons' Residence


Anna: Hey Bethanne.
Anna: What are you guys watching? You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time? There are over one hundred and fifty channels. It's called a remote control. This button changes the channel. Hold it like this.


Miss Gibbons: Did you get enough sweetheart?
Frederick: For now.
Miss Gibbons: Anna, are you hungry? Did you want a little?
Anna: No, thank you Miss Gibbons. Why don't you lie down for a while and get some rest?
Frederick: She's fine. Aren't you Miss Gibbons?


Miss Gibbons: Of course I am. I'm fine.


Donovan Residence
Matt: Hey mom! Mom?


Matt: Hey mom?


Kelly: What? I'm trying to sleep.
Matt: I was just making sure you're alive.
Kelly: I'm sorry sweetie. It was a late night. My head is throbbing.
Matt: I would appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home. And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it too.
Kelly: It wasn't a party, it was one guy, don't be so judgy.
Matt: Well, I talked to Roberta at the grill and there's still a bartending position open if you want to...get a job.
Kelly: I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I worked there.
Matt: I think she's desperate.
Kelly: I'll check it out.
Matt: Yeah?
Kelly: Don't act so surprised.
Matt: Well, I mean...I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
Kelly: Well, there's back rent due.
Matt: There's back everything mom.
Kelly: Like I said, I'll check it out.


Kelly: Who's that?
Matt: It's Caroline.


Matt: Easy.


Matt: Yeah come in!


Caroline: Hi Mrs. Donovan.


Matt: Hey, ok. Well we're going to be late. So let's get going.


Caroline: Yeah.
Matt: Hey.
Caroline: Hey.
Matt: How are you?
Caroline: Good.
Mystic Falls High School
Stefan: Damon hasn't said a word to me. Every time I try to talk to him he shuts me down.
Elena: Do you think he's still trying to find Katherine?
Stefan: I don't know. He waited a hundred and forty five years only to find out that Katherine could not care less. I mean it's gotta hurt, right?
Elena: And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
Stefan: You have every reason to be upset with him. Have you thought any more about what you're going to do?
Elena: About what? Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's related to my vampire ancestor Katherine, who screwed over your vampire brother? Nah...I haven't thought about it at all.
Stefan: I'm sorry I brought it up.
Elena: It'd just be nice if we could get through one day without having to deal with any of it. No vampire mother or brother.
Stefan: No vampires at all?
Elena: No vampires but you. I just want to get us back to normal stuff like school and homework and here's a thought: fun.
Stefan: Ooh, that sounds good to me, when do we start?


Matt: We can watch a movie at my place.
Caroline: With your mom and a six pack?
Matt: You know...you don't really help the situation. You could at least try to be nice.
Caroline: Oh...I'm sorry. It's hard for me to show kindness to people that hate me. I'm not that evolved.


Caroline: So, a movie tonight?
Matt: Wherever you want to do it's good for me but I'm late and I got to go OK?
Caroline: OK.


Miss Gibbons' Residence
Pearl: The keypad is for texting which is what you do when you want to avoid talking to someone.


Harper: I didn't break it, I swear.
Pearl: I was just showing Harper what you taught me. What a marvelous device!
Harper: Who was that?
Anna: Jeremy Gilbert.
Harper: Is that your boyfriend?
Pearl: Of course not.


Pearl: What do you think?
Anna: Very respectable.
Pearl: That's the goal. I can't say that I miss corsets.
Anna: Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys and her ATM card.
Pearl: What's that?
Anna: I'll explain later.


Frederick: Where are you going?
Pearl: We have some business in town. We'll be back as soon as we can. I trust that you'll keep an eye on things.
Frederick: So, I'm the baby sitter now?
Pearl: Frederick, if this is going to work we have to cooperate with one another.
Frederick: So you saying...
Harper: I'll watch things miss Pearl.
Pearl: Thank you Harper.


Mystic Falls High School
Caroline: I'm thinking nothing huge, just a dinner at the grill maybe a late movie.
Stefan: You mean like a double date?
Caroline: Two pair out on a Friday night coupled. Yeah a double date.
Elena: Do you think that's a good idea?
Caroline: Why not? We all haven't gone out together before and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us. Look the couple dynamics have changed and there's been a little awkwardness between you, Matt, and me and I just think it's important that we get over it.
Elena: I don't know.
Stefan: I think that sounds like a great idea.
Elena: You do?
Stefan: Yeah. A nice evening out with friends. Sounds fun, as in fun.
Elena: A double date it is.
Caroline: Ok. So, we will see you tonight.
Elena: OK.


Elena: OK.
Salvatore Boarding House


Pearl: Hello Damon.
Damon: Ever hear of knocking?
Pearl: An invitation wasn't necessary. I'm surprised that no living person resides here. Is it just you and your brother?
Anna: Yeah. How do you keep out unwelcome vampires?
Damon: I kill them.


Pearl: Have a seat, Damon. I was hoping we could have a word.
Damon: Sure.
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy : How do you become a vampire?
User : Brad Pitt changed me.
User : Go to Vegas. Ask for Wayne Newton.
Jeremy : How do you kill a vampire?
User : The blood of Paula Abdul.
Jeremy : Great.
Jeremy : Serious answers only please.
User : Stake in the heart always works.
Jeremy : You're a believer?
User : Aren't you?
Salvatore Boarding House
Pearl: We've taken up residence at a farmhouse just outside the town. It'll suffice for now.
Damon: All 25 vampires?
Pearl: Not all, some. I imagine that a few have already left town. Others are probably still in the woods or like us acclimating.


Damon: How did they get out of the tomb?
Anna: I think the witch screwed up that part of her hocus pocus.
Pearl: I understand from Anna that the founding families still have a secret council?
Anna: And you're a part of it.
Damon: That's ridiculous.
Anna: I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet, Damon. I'm up to speed.
Pearl: And so am I. And now that you've infiltrated the council, I'll need to know everything they know. Starting with a listing names of all the council members and their families.
Anna: And everyone you've supplied with vervain.
Pearl: Yes, that will have to stop immediately.
Damon: What exactly are you trying to achieve?
Pearl: Mystic Falls is our home, Damon. They took that from us. Our land, our home. It's time we rebuild.
Damon: What, are you crazy? It was 1864. Wake up woman. The world has moved on.
Pearl: As a reward for your help I'm willing to give you what you want most.
Damon: I want nothing.
Pearl: Katherine.
Damon: You wouldn't even know where she was. You've been under the ground for the last century and a half.
Pearl: Katherine and I were best friends long before we came to Mystic Falls, Damon. I know how she thinks, I know her patterns, I know where to find her.
Damon: I no longer have any desire to see Katherine ever again. And there's no way in hell I'm gonna play the role of your little minion.


Pearl: I'm not asking for your help, Damon. Finding Katherine was just a mere gesture of kindness. The rest is non-negotiable.


Pearl: I have four hundred years on you, little boy. I'll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking and you know it. I'll be in touch.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: You got me flowers!
Stefan: I figured it's a date, why not do it right? I would have driven too but you're the one with the car.
Elena: You know, you think that for someone who was around when the car was invented you would have one.
Stefan: Oh, I have one. I just never drive it.
Elena: You know, it's not too late to cancel.
Stefan: Why we would do that?
Elena: I don't know, it just seems surreal. Like maybe we weren't meant to get to the normal part.
Stefan: That's exactly why we're going to do it. We're going to go out, have some fun and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious. Listen, when I decided to stay here and to get to know you, it so that I could do things like this. Bring my girlfriend flowers, take her out on a date, and try to be normal.
Elena: Have you ever even been on a double date before?
Stefan: Oh, absolutely. '72, Hef and the twins.
Elena: What?
Stefan: Yeah...playmates. I got Miss June.
Elena: Are you serious?
Mystic Falls


Pearl: Miss Sommers?
Jenna: Yes. Hi Pearl.
Pearl: Hi. This is my Daughter, Annabelle.
Jenna: Of course, Jeremy's friend.
Anna: Nice to see you, Miss Sommers.
Jenna: Oh, Jenna, please. This property was in my brother in law's family for generations. It's one of the originals structure in Mystic Falls. It used to be one of those old fashioned drugstore thingies.
Pearl: An apothecary?
Jenna: Yeah.
Pearl: You don't say.


Jenna: Sorry if it's a little musty.


Jenna: No one has been here for months.
Pearl: I'll use my imagination.


Pearl: Annabelle?
Anna: I'm coming mother.


Mystic Grill


Kelly: What's with the glasses inside?
Damon: My eyes were a little sensitive today.
Kelly: You're new around here.
Damon: On the contrary, I'm very old.


Damon: Bourbon, neat.
Kelly: I haven't been gone that long. I would remember someone who looked like you.
Damon: Yeah. Where did you go?
Kelly: Around, about.
Damon: I've been there.
Kelly: I love to see a man drown his sorrows. It's so sexy.
Damon: It's more like nursing my wounds. And you?
Kelly: I was supposed interviewing for the bartender job but I think the manager blew me off.
Damon: Well, that's not very nice.
Kelly: Yeah. Last time I was in town I slept with her boyfriend.
Damon: That's not very nice either.
Kelly: It happens.
Damon: Yes it does.


Jenna: Kelly? Kelly Donovan?
Kelly: Jenna!


Jenna: I heard you were back in town.  She used to babysit me.
Kelly: And then I used to party with her.
Jenna: This woman is crazy.
Kelly: Not as crazy as you.
Jenna: I'm not anymore.
Kelly: Well sit, drink!
Jenna: I shouldn't. I'm more responsible now. Haven't you heard?
Kelly: Well, take a night off its good for the soul.
Damon: Great for the soul.


Jenna: This is not going to end well.
Damon: Can't wait.


Miss Gibbons' Residence
Frederick: I hate this house.
Bethanne: It's better than the tomb.
Frederick: I didn't stay locked up for a hundred and forty five years to end up locked here.
Harper: Maybe you should quit complaining.


Frederick: You're going to stop me?
Bethanne: Let it be Frederick. You heard what Pearl said.
Frederick: I don't care what Pearl said.  What you got boy?


Frederick: Try that again.


Pearl: Back off. Back off! We don't fight each other. Those are the rules.
Frederick: And I'm tired of your rules. I want out of this house. Why can't we go out on the town?
Pearl: Eventually. But for now we have to keep a low profile.
Frederick: No one knows who I am.
Pearl: The Salvatore's brothers do.
Frederick: And I wish to hell that I could run into them. There are the reason we were caught in the first place.
Mystic Grill
Elena: So, Matt, How do you like working here?
Matt: It's not that bad. Wait staff is pretty good and they can't keep a bartender to save their lives. I actually put my mom up for a job.
Elena: How has that been? Having Kelly back?
Matt: You know, same old Kelly. She's trying, sort of.
Elena: Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up. That's how Matt and I first met, we shared a crib together.
Stefan: You're kidding?
Matt: No, we have known each other our whole lives.


Matt: You got to be kidding me.
Miss Gibbons' Residence


Harper: Where are you going?
Frederick: Bethanne and I are going out for a bit. Hit the town, kick up our heels.
Harper: We're not supposed to leave. Miss Pearl made that very clear.
Frederick: You're going to stop me? I didn't think so.


Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: Anna?
Anna: Surprised?
Jeremy: I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
Anna: Change of plans. Sorry, I thought you'd be psyched.
Jeremy: No, no, no. I mean...I am. Of course I am.
Anna: Alright then, step aside.


Mystic Grill
Jenna: Don't be grumpy. It can't be that bad.
Damon: You'd be surprised. My primary reason for existence has abandoned me and after today's events, the remains of the shakey ground that I walk on are about to go kaboom. Let's get hammered.
Kelly: Let's.




Caroline: At least they're having fun.
Elena: They're drunk.
Matt: Remember when Elena's parents busted us here after the homecoming?
Caroline : Oh my god yes!
Elena: Well, we were wasted; it was the first time I ever got drunk. I blame Matt.
Matt: Her parents got seated at the next booth.
Elena: And Matt had me pretend that I was choking so we could get away.
Matt: Except that her dad was a doctor so he jumped up to save her.
Elena: And I ran, slipped on the wet floor and bit it in front of everyone. Do you remember that? 3 stitches, a hangover for days and I was grounded from seeing this one  for a week.


Caroline: I'm gonna go to the restroom. Elena?


Jenna: Hide. We're not here.
Kelly: Why? Where'd we go?
Jenna: Children under our care. Five o'clock. This is not good.


Kelly: Damn!
Gilbert Residence
Jeremy: What made you and your mom decide to stay in town?
Anna: She got this business opportunity; she's going to open up a little store. It has always been her dream. So yeah we're staying. And I'm thinking about going back to high school, so you'll be seeing a little more of me.
Jeremy: Yeah?
Anna: Enough of homeschooling. I'd like to be a normal teen for once. But I have to ask my mom first, she'll have an opinion.
Jeremy: Well, I wish you were there now. I actually have to write another paper. I was thinking about squeezing one more out on the vampire in Mystic Falls.
Anna: Really? Haven't you exhausted the subject?
Jeremy: No, I want to go deeper, you know. I want to understand why people were labelled as vampires back in the day. I mean, maybe there's such a thing has vampires, they're just different from the way we always thought they were.
Anna: What do you mean?
Jeremy: Well, maybe they're normal and good, just outsiders you know? Um, misunderstood.
Anna: You're kidding, right?
Jeremy: Don't you think it could be possible? You did give me all that info.
Anna: Jeremy, I made it up ok? You were all cute and floppy and I wanted to make a good impression.
Mystic Grill
Matt: Is there anything you're not good at?
Stefan: Double dating. This is all kind of new to me. I usually keep to myself. I don't always fit in.
Matt: That's because you're that guy.
Stefan: What guy?
Matt: The guy who seems like he has everything, so the people that don't, kind of run the other way.
Stefan: Is that what I seem like?
Matt: Pretty much.
Stefan: Hmm...What a dick!
Matt: Yeah.


Caroline: So um, what are you doing?
Elena: What?
Caroline: Well the point of this was to show him how much you care about Stefan. You know, not to hopscotch down memory lane.
Elena: I was just trying to make conversation.
Caroline: Try less.


Elena: Caroline.


Frederick: Katherine?
Elena: I'm sorry, you have the wrong person.


Caroline: Elena, come on!
Frederick: My mistake.


Elena: How's everything going?
Stefan: Matt's cheating.
Matt: No need, I'm awesome.
Frederick : Stefan Salvatore.
Stefan : Everything okay?
Elena: Everything's great.


Elena: That man over there just called me Katherine


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: So, you didn't recognize him, you haven't seen him before?
Elena: No, there was nothing familiar about him at all.
Stefan: Right, let's call it a night. OK? Send Matt and Caroline home?
Elena: No, the whole point of the night was to not have to deal with this stuff. We need to get through one night. One normal night.
Stefan: You're sure?
Elena: No, I'm not sure, but I don't know what else to do. Look, if there's another vampire in town, he'll still be here tomorrow. We'll deal with it tomorrow.
Stefan: OK.


Stefan: It's them. Come here.




Caroline: This is much better than watching Damon visit cougar town.  No offence.
Matt: Don't remind me. : Man I've always wanted to see what it looks like in this place.
Stefan: Yeah, I guess it's a bit much.
Matt: Yeah, my entire house could fit in here. like twice.
Caroline: Feel like I've been here before. It's weird.


Elena: Do you guys want to watch a movie or something?
Matt: Whoa; these are great!


Stefan: This is uh...a little hobby of mine.
Matt: I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9
Stefan: You like cars?
Matt: It's an understatement.
Stefan: Come with me.

Damon: So, the thing about cherries, you have to...


Damon: Oh my goodness.


Damon: That's amazing, you were fast.
Jenna: That would be my cue.
Kelly : You're given up already?
Jenna: Oh yeah.


Jenna: See you guys.
Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: Prepare yourself, my friend.


Matt: Wait, how do you have this?
Stefan: Got passed down through the family.


Matt: Why don't you...I mean...Why don't you drive it?
Stefan: Well, it doesn't run. I mean, it's not that I could figure out.
Caroline: Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
Matt: Be more of a girl right now?


Stefan : Hey, want to come take a look at this for me?
Matt: Elena, remember the old Camaro you're dad used to have?
Elena: Of course.
Matt: I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
Stefan: wow.
Caroline: I don't like sports cars; they're too hard to make out in.
Matt : It wasn't that bad.


Matt : I'm sorry man.
Stefan: No, no, no. Don't worry about it. You and Elena, you guys have a history and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good.
Matt: She's good with you. You know, I wasn't sure but she's happy and I'm glad.


Matt: Alright, let's take a look at this.
Mystic Grill


Frederick: Need some help?
Jenna: Damn it! Stupid shoe.
Frederick: Pick up your other foot.


Frederick: Here you go.
Jenna: Thanks, I think.
Frederick: Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
Jenna: The one and only. You know him?
Frederick: We go way back. He still live out by Miller Lane?
Jenna: He lives in the old boarding house by Wickery Bridge. He's still in there if you want to say hi.
Frederick: I prefer to stay here and talk to you.
Jenna: Oh, nice. Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt. But, I'm a little drunk and a guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.


Frederick: I'm pretty sure you'd like it.


Jenna: Sorry. That was a seriously lame pick up.
Frederick: That is a nice scent you wear. What is it?
Jenna: I don't know  it was a gift. And that is a cab so...


Frederick: Vervain...making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Caroline...
Caroline: I don't want to talk about it.
Elena: You're being ridiculous.
Caroline: And insecure and stupid. But that doesn't change the fact that Matt's always gonna be in love with you and I'm always gonna be the back up.
Elena: You're not the back up.
Caroline: Yes I'm. I'm Matt's Elena back up; I'm your Bonnie back up.
Elena: Now it's about me and Bonnie?
Caroline: You don't get it. Why would you? You're everyone's first choice.


Matt: Piece of cake!


Stefan: You know what? Why don't you guys go ahead and take it for a spin?
Matt: Really?
Stefan: Yeah.
Matt: Caroline?


Stefan: You alright?
Elena: If it's not vampires, its girlfriends.


Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: Alright. Roast beef, turkey, what do you want?
Anna: Let's do the works. Pile it high.
Jeremy: Ok, I like your style. Will you grab the bread for me?
Anna: Ok.


Anna: What are you doing?
Jeremy: It's just a cut. Can you hand me that towel?


Anna: I can't.
Jeremy: You got a problem with blood Anna?


Jeremy: What's the matter? It's just blood, Anna.


Anna: What are you doing?


Jeremy: I knew it.  Go for it.


Jeremy: Jenna! Hey, what's up?
Jenna: Regret. Make sure you lock that up.


Woods


Matt: Did I just pass the driveway?
Caroline: Uh...No, I think it's up there.
Matt: This is an amazing car. Did I pass?


Matt: The whole double date thing was obviously a test to see how I would do around Elena.
Caroline: I don't know. You were reminiscing about the Elena years the whole night so...
Matt: Caroline that stuff came before. It's not just gonna go away.
Caroline: I know that okay? I know.
Matt: No, you don't. Because, you're letting Elena turn you into a crazy person. Look it's my fault. I made it pretty clear early on that Elena still means something to me. But all that talk, that was just two old friends and some memories. Tonight wasn't about me and Elena. I was there because I wanted to be with you. And I don't know what this means or what we are but I do know that you are the only person I want to be in this car with right now. And I don't even know if that makes sense because I'm not really that good at expressing myself.
Caroline: No, no. I think you're doing just fine.


Caroline: Sports cars...
Matt: Yeah.


Salvatore Boarding House


Kelly: Now that you've got me here.  What are you gonna do with me?
Damon: I'm going to...going to do this.


Matt: Mom?!
Caroline: Damon?!
Kelly: Oh my god, Matt! Oh my god.


Matt: I got to...
Caroline: It's fine, just go.
Elena : I'll take her home.
Matt: Thanks, man.


Miss Gibbons' Residence


Pearl: Where have you been?
Anna: I needed some air.
Pearl: For three hours? Tell me, where have you been?
Anna: Out, I was out.
Pearl: Annabelle, don't do this. I can't fight you too. What?
Anna: I'm sorry.


Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Sorry I'm bailing.
Stefan: Just wish you let me drive you home.
Elena: Normal people don't have chaperones or bodyguards or baby-sitters. We're normal tonight, remember?
Stefan: I know, I just get so worry about you.
Elena: Stefan, I can't live every minute afraid that someone is gonna come after me. I won't, it's not living.
Stefan: Okay. Call me when you get home safe.


Caroline: Bye Stefan.
Stefan: Goodbye.




Damon: Don't look at me like that.
Stefan: Are you crazy?
Damon: Save the lecture. Look...


Damon: Damn it.
Stefan: I remember them from 1864. They were in the tomb.
Damon: Yeah...About that.


Donovan Residence


Kelly: Matt...Matt....
Matt: I don't want to hear it, mom.
Kelly: Matty, please...
Matt: Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom? I was having fun, you know, trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day. Just enjoying a night with my friends. And then, there you are, wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way, to pay the bills that you don't pay. And then you're off acting like a freakin' kid, hooking up with some guy half your age. I'm the kid, Mom. You're supposed to be responsible for me.
Kelly: I know Matt.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: How was your night?
Jeremy: Ah...Same old. Same old...You?
Elena: Yep.
Miss Gibbons' Residence


Pearl: So, where's Bethanne?
Frederick: She won't be coming back.
Pearl: What happened? Where is she?
Frederick: Well, you were right. We shouldn't have left.
Pearl: No. Hungry?


Pearl: Next time you'll listen to me.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: I'm home, teeth brushed, and ready for bed. Save and sound.
Stefan: Good, good. I'm glad.
Elena: Is everything alright? You sound serious.
Stefan: No, no, no, no. Not tonight, you still have a few minutes left of normal. I'll tell you about it tomorrow okay?
Elena: I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
Stefan: Such a liar.
Elena: No, I'm serious. In a way it was exactly what it was supposed to be.
Stefan: I had a really nice time too.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon : Could you help me out a little bit?
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: What the hell?
Anna: I could have killed you!
Jeremy: Yeah, but you didn't.
Anna: I should have.
Jeremy: But you didn't.
Anna: How did you know?
Jeremy: I knew this girl. Vicki. She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck. She started acting crazy, weird, and it seemed like drugs, but then you showed me those articles. And then I saw your face and how it changed the night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
Anna: You know you can't tell anyone, right?
Jeremy: Who would believe me?
Anna: You'd be surprised.
Jeremy: Why didn't you kill me?
Anna: I don't know. Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.
Jeremy: Like what?
Anna: Lost. Why would you confront me about it? Why would you risk it?
Jeremy: Because if it was true, maybe it's true about Vicki. And also because...I want you to turn me.

Gilbert Residence


Anna: I love storms.
Jeremy: Is that a vampire thing? Cause I read vampires don't like running water.
Anna: It's only Dracula. Yeah. He was a complete wuss. Never showered. Very smelly.
Jeremy: Seriously?
Anna: First rule about vampires, don't believe anything you read.
Jeremy: You gotta tell me more. I gotta know.
Anna: No, you don't. Cause you're not gonna be one.
Jeremy: Come on, you can't keep saying no to me.
Anna: Look, I'm not gonna turn someone who learned everything he knows about vampires from Netflix.
Jeremy: That's not true, and you know it.
Anna: Why do you even want this? Give me one good reason.
Jeremy: Cause I...
Anna: Hmm. Let me know when you can finish that sentence.


Elena: Hey, you're still up.
Jeremy: Hey, what's up?
Elena: Looks like the there's a big storm rolling in. Can you help make sure all the windows are closed?
Jeremy: Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

Miss Gibbons' Residence


Frederick: We're running low on blood. You might wanna send Anna to the hospital for some more.
Pearl: I'll send her out for some tomorrow.
Frederick: Maybe I could go with her. If the storm keeps it dark enough, I might be able to go out during the day, no sun and all.
Pearl: I'm afraid not. Not after your stunt at the Salvatore house tonight.
Frederick: He and his brother deserved it.
Pearl: And where did that get you? Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead. And you have no one to blame but yourself. We cannot live our lives about revenge. We have to have better control of our emotions.
Frederick: I understand, Miss Pearl. I just wish I knew what you were up to.
Pearl: I'm going to make an exploratory visit into town tomorrow to assess who's under the influence of vervain and who isn't. Anna tells me that the players haven't changed much. It's still the Lockwoods, the Forbes, the Fells...
Frederick: We should kill every last one of them.
Pearl: We are smarter than that, Frederick. These people are not our enemies. We don't hold grudges and resentments. We'll get our town back. We just have to have patience.


Frederick: You heard her. No revenge. Patience. Self-control. She seems to have it all figured out, doesn't she?


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: I say we go to Pearl's, bust down the door, and annihilate the idiot that attacked us last night.
Stefan: Yeah. And then what? We turn to the rest of that house of vampires and say, Oops. Sorry?
Elena: I can't believe you made a deal with her.
Damon: It was more like a helpful exchange of information. And it's not like I had a choice. She's...scary. Besides, she's gonna help me get Katherine back.
Elena: Of course she is. Damon gets what he wants, as usual. No matter who he hurts in the process.
Damon: You don't have to be snarky about it.
Elena: I woke up this morning to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb. I've earned snarky.
Damon: How long are you going to blame me for turning your birth mother into a vampire?
Elena: I'm not blaming you, Damon. I've accepted the fact that you're a self-serving psychopath with no redeeming qualities.
Damon: Ouch.
Stefan: This isn't being very productive. We're gonna figure out a way to deal with Pearl and the vampires. Yeah? Hmm.


Elena: I'm sorry. He just makes me so cranky.
Stefan: I know. He makes everybody cranky.
Elena: So, what are we going to do?
Stefan: Damon and I are gonna handle everything, I promise.
Elena: Well, what about me? I can't just sit here and do nothing.
Stefan: That's exactly what you're gonna do, because that's what going to keep you safe.
Elena: Which means nothing if you're not safe, too.
Stefan: What do you mean? I'm perfectly safe. I have Damon, the self-serving psychopath on my side.
Elena: Well, that's comforting.
Mystic Grill


Anna: Okay. We have some time. I'm not meeting my mom until later.
Jeremy: Wait. Does your mom know you're a...
Anna: The fact that you would even think it's possible to keep something like that a secret from your own family is just further proof that you're not ready.
Jeremy: Not ready Is a step up from No.
Anna: And a million steps down from Maybe. I like your bracelet.
Jeremy: Thanks. My sister got it for me.
Anna: Can I see it?
Jeremy: Yeah. Yeah.
Anna: Your sister doesn't know you're hanging out with me, does she?
Jeremy: No. No. But I don't see why it would be a problem. It's not like she knows what you are.
Anna: I'd rather keep it our little secret.
Jeremy: You know, why don't you...why don't you keep this?
Anna: Why would you give this to me?
Jeremy: Because. You like it. And I like you.
Anna: You only like me because of what you want from me.
Jeremy: No. I...I like you.
Anna: Um...You know, you should wear it. It looks better on you anyway.


Matt: I yelled at my mom last night. You know, I feel like the parent yelling at the screwed up kid.
Caroline: Maybe she needed to hear it.
Matt: Yeah, but just...I worry that if I push too hard, then she will take off again. Cause that's her M.O. Just like Vicki, who I haven't heard from since she left.
Caroline: Well, you can't control your mom, Matt, any more than you can control your sister.
Matt: I wish that she would just try a little. You know? If she would just try to try, that'd be okay.
Caroline: Maybe she'll surprise you. People have a tendency to do that. I should go before the roads get even worse from the storm.
Matt: Yeah. Are you sure you should be driving right now?
Caroline: I have to. It's my dad's boyfriend's daughter's birthday. We have a non-traditional traditional ritual.
Matt: Well, buckle up. Don't speed. Stay off your cell phone. And call me when you get there.
Caroline: Got it. Anything else?
Matt: Yes.


Caroline: Bye.
Matt: Bye.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Hunting party?
Stefan: That guy did a number on me last night when he stabbed me. I gotta get my strength back up.
Damon: I've got two liters of soccer mom in the fridge. No?
Stefan: We'll talk when I get back?
Damon: All right. Give my regards to the squirrels.
Woods


Stefan: Aah!
Gilbert Residence


Damon: You're ignoring me.
Elena: The 6 missed calls? Sorry. My phone is dead.
Damon: Is Stefan here?
Elena: No. Why? Something wrong?
Damon: He went out in the woods and didn't come back. I can't get him on his phone. I figured he was here with you.
Elena: It's going straight to voice-mail. Where could he be?
Damon: You're not going to like what I'm thinking.
Miss Gibbons' Residence


Damon: Pearl! Open this door. I swear to God I'll bust through and rip your head off.


Frederick: Pearl's not home. Hmm. Beautiful weather. Not a ray of sun in the sky.
Damon: Where's my brother?
Frederick: Billy.


Damon: You're dead.
Frederick: Whoa. I'm sorry. You haven't been invited in. Miss Gibbons?


Miss Gibbons: Yes, Frederick, honey?
Frederick: Never let this bad man in.
Miss Gibbons: I'll never let him in.
Stefan: Ugh!
Frederick: 145 years left starving in a tomb, thanks to Katherine's infatuation with you and your brother. First few weeks, every single nerve in your body screams with fire. The kind of pain that can drive a person mad. Well...I thought your brother might want to get a taste of that before I killed him. Billy.


Stefan: Uhh! Aah!
Frederick: You have a nice day.
Woods


Elena: What happened? Where is he?
Damon: They have him. I can't get in.
Elena: Why not?
Damon: Because the woman who owns the house is compelled to not let me in.
Elena: I can get in.
Damon: You're not going in there.
Elena: I'm going!
Damon: You're not going in there.
Elena: Why are they doing this? What do they want with him?
Damon: Revenge. They want revenge.
Elena: We gotta do something.
Damon: I know.
Elena: We can't let them hurt him. We gotta get him out of there.
Damon: I know. Elena, I know. But I don't know how to get him out.
Miss Gibbons' Residence


Frederick: Vervain on the ropes.
Stefan: Aah! Unh!
Frederick: That's gotta sting. Speaking of...


Stefan: Aah!


Harper: This isn't right!
Frederick: He killed Beth-Anne. One of us, Harper. And don't you think for a second he wouldn't kill you if he had the chance. Pearl says we're not here for revenge, right? I say that's exactly what we're here for. Starting with this.


Stefan: Aah! Aah!
Frederick: And then his brother. And anyone else that gets in our way.
Harper: This isn't right!
Frederick: You're gonna want to let go of me!
Harper: Miss Pearl will be home soon.
Frederick: Miss Pearl is no longer in charge. Tie him up! And then stake him down.
Mystic Falls High School


Damon: Well, don't you look...alive?
Alaric: You can't hurt me.
Damon: Oh, I can hurt you, all right.
Elena: Mr. Saltzman. We need your help.


Elena: Stefan's in the house. Damon's a vampire. He can't get in. We need you. I would go, but...
Damon: But your life is valuable. Yours, on the other hand is...
Elena: Stefan told me about your ring.
Alaric: What about it?
Damon: Let me recap...You tried to kill me. I defended myself. You died. Then according to my brother, your ring brought you back to life. Am I leaving anything out?
Alaric: Yeah. The part where I try and kill you again. Only this time, I don't miss.
Elena: Mr. Saltzman. Please. It's Stefan.
Alaric: I'm sorry, Elena. But it's not my problem.
Damon: That's a shame. Because the woman in charge of the crowd can help you find your wife.
Alaric: You're lying.
Damon: Am I? Why don't you ask her for yourself? Coward. Come on, Elena.


Alaric: All right! Wait. I'll go.
Mystic Grill


Jeremy: So, I have an answer.
Anna: To what?
Jeremy: Why you should turn me.
Anna: We're back to that?
Jeremy: Look, I wake up every day, and I feel okay, but there's something missing. Like a...like a hole. Some people, they fit...in life, or whatever. I...I don't.
Anna: So, you want a pity-turn? I don't think so.
Jeremy: You should turn me because I don't have anything else.
Anna: Do you even know why we turn other people? It's not to give someone a one-way ticket out of loner-hood. Okay? One, we need someone to do our dirty work. Two, revenge. Three, boredom...but, you know, that never turns out well. And then you know there's the obvious one. You love someone so much that you would do anything to spend all of eternity with them. Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't fit any of those categories yet.


Anna: So, yeah. Just make sure your thesis is clear, and she'll love it. See you later.


Anna: Mom, hey.
Pearl: Did you get everything?
Anna: Yeah, the blood-bank was understaffed because of the rain. I was in and out.
Pearl: Who's that you were talking to?
Anna: A friend from the library.
Pearl: Let's get home.


Mr. Lockwood: Hey, you're not going out in that, are ya? The roads are dangerous. Route 5 is completely flooded.
Pearl: We'll make do.
Waitress: Mayor Lockwood, we have your table ready.
Tyler: Great.
Pearl: Mayor...Lockwood, is it? I suppose it is treacherous outside. My name is Pearl.
Mr. Lockwood: Hi.
Pearl: This is my daughter Anna. We've just recently moved to town.
Mr. Lockwood: Welcome. Richard Lockwood. This is my son Tyler. Please--please, join us.
Pearl: It would be a pleasure.
Tyler: Be more creepy, dad. Not like your son is standing right here.
Mr. Lockwood: Grow up. Elections are coming. She's a constituent. And a rich one, from the looks of it.
Tyler: You can tell all that by looking at her ass? Awesome. I'm gonna go shoot some pool.
Mystic Falls High School


Damon: Teacher by day, vampire hunter by night.
Alaric: I've you to thank for that.
Elena: What are these?
Alaric: Those are tranquilizer darts filled with vervain.
Damon: Just get me in. I'll get Stefan out.
Elena: That's your plan? You're just gonna take them all on yourself?
Damon: Well, I'll be a little stealthier than that, hopefully.


Alaric: Whoa. What are you doing?
Elena: I'm going with you guys.
Damon: No. No. No. No. No way.
Elena: You need me. I'll get in. You could distract them, and then I'll get Stefan out.
Damon: You'll get yourself killed. You're not going in there.
Elena: I'm going.
Damon: So, when you get me in, get out as quickly as you can. I know how to sneak around where they can't hear me. You'll basically just be in the way.
Elena: Damon, now is not the time to be the lone ranger.
Damon: Fine. Elena, you can drive the getaway car. You're not going in the house.
Elena: You can't stop me. It's Stefan we're talking about here. You don't understand.
Damon: Oh, I understand. I understand. He's the reason you live. His love lifts you up where you belong. I get it.
Elena: Can you just not joke around for 2 seconds?
Damon: I can't protect you, Elena. I don't know how many vampires there are in there. That's how long it takes you to get your head ripped off. I have to be able to get in and get out. I can't be distracted with your safety. Or this will end up a bloodbath that none of us walk away from...Including Stefan. I know. I get it. I understand.
Alaric: If we're gonna go, let's go.
Mystic Grill and Caroline's Car


Matt: Where are you? I can barely hear you.
Caroline: Storm washed out Route 5. Now I'm detoured on some random backwoods path to hell.
Matt: Well, you shouldn't be talking while you're driving.
Caroline: I know, right? I need one of those little bluetooth thingies.
Matt: Look, you're breaking up. Just turn around and go back the same way you came. And watch the road. Okay?
Caroline: Okay.
Woods


Caroline: God. Ohh. Ohh. Seriously?


Miss Gibbons' Residence


Alaric: Oh, good, someone's home. Uh, could I use your phone? My car broke down a few miles up the road. This was the first house I saw.
Frederick: Well, lucky you.
Alaric: Yeah. Lucky me. It's no trouble, is it?
Frederick: Not in the slightest.
Alaric: Great. Whew.


Alaric: Hey, man, I really appreciate it. It's rough out there.
Frederick: Billy, show our visitor where the phone is in the kitchen. And get me something to drink.
Billy: Yeah. Sure thing.
Billy: Hey, Miss Gibbons, this guy wants to use your phone.
Miss Gibbons: Oh, sure, honey. It's right there.
Alaric: Thanks.


Billy: Aah!


Miss Gibbons: What's happening?
Alaric: I'm really sorry. But you're gonna need to invite a friend of mine inside.


Miss Gibbons: Oh, I'm sorry. He's not allowed in the house.
Alaric: I know that. But you've gotta make an exception.
Damon: Get her out of the house. Now! Miss Gibbons, tell me the truth. Are you married?
Miss Gibbons: No.
Damon: Parents, children, anyone else who lives on this property?
Miss Gibbons: No. It's just me.
Damon: No? Good.


Alaric: You were supposed to compel her.
Damon: It doesn't work that way...
Alaric: She is human.
Damon: And I'm not! So, I don't care. Now, get out of here. And get rid of the body!

Pearl: I'm in the process of obtaining some property. I understand that your family is the largest property owner in town.
Mr. Lockwood: Well, yes we are. Dating all the way back to the town's original charter.
Pearl: Your family came into a lot of new property in 1864.
Mr. Lockwood: You know your history.
Pearl: It's a passion of mine.
Tyler: Guy's not even subtle about it.
Matt: Who is that?
Tyler: It's not my mother.


Pearl: I'm sorry, Mayor. Do you know that boy over there?
Mr. Lockwood: Yeah it's Jeremy Gilbert.
Pearl: You don't say.

Pearl: Jeremy Gilbert? Is that what you've been up to?
Anna: He's my friend. What's the big deal?
Pearl: His family is the reason I was stuck in a tomb for over a century.
Anna: That doesn't mean he'll make the same choices.
Pearl: I want you to stop seeing him.
Anna: I've been on my own for a long time, mother. I can make my own decisions.
Pearl: Then stop acting like a child! As soon as Jeremy finds out what you really are, he will turn on you.
Anna: He already knows.
Pearl: What did you just say?
Anna: Jeremy knows. He likes it. And he likes me.


Miss Gibbons' Residence


Stefan: Uhh. Thank you. For trying to help me.
Harper: They just needed somebody to blame. Someone to punish.


Stefan: Elena...You shouldn't be here...
Damon: She was supposed to stay in the car.
Stefan: Unh! No. No. No. Not him.
Damon: Whatever. Let's get you down.
Stefan: There's vervain on the ropes.
Damon: Elena, pull that.
Stefan: Unh!
Damon: All right, let's go. Clothes on.
Stefan: Wait.
Damon: What? Guys, come on. We have to get out of here.


Stefan: Uhh!
Damon: Come on, we gotta go.
Stefan: The other one.
Harper: Uhh!
Damon: Can you get him in the car?
Elena: Yeah.
Damon: All right, go.
Elena: What about you?
Damon: You rescue, I'll distract. Go.


Frederick : Turn that down. It's too quiet.


Frederick: Spread out. Now. You two, back of the house. Go. Check out both rooms. Cellar, now.

Kelly: Well, sit down. You might wanna order pizza. I'm out of practice.
Matt: Mmm. Mystery casserole. Yum.
Kelly: Yeah. Some people aren't meant for the kitchen.
Matt: What?
Kelly: Uh, I know it's been rough. But I'm gonna try. I mean, really try this time. You just have to bear with me, okay?
Matt: Okay.
Kelly: Okay. Good.

Elena: No. I trust you.


Miss Gibbons' Residence


Alaric: So, what you said to get me to do this, about my wife. It was a lie, wasn't it?
Damon: Yep.
Pearl: Stop. What's going on here? What did you do?
Damon: Me? Your merry little band of vampires spent the day torturing my brother.
Pearl: Trust me. The parties responsible for this will be dealt with.
Damon: Our little arrangement doesn't work unless you learn to control them.
Pearl: This wasn't supposed to happen.
Damon: Well, it did. If I had a good side...Not a way to get on it.


Woods


Stefan: Argh! Ahh! Aah! Aah!
Elena: Stefan. Stefan!


Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: How are you doing?
Stefan: I'm okay. The wounds have mostly healed.
Elena: Good.
Stefan: Elena...
Elena: Yeah?
Stefan: What you did today, coming to help me...You could have been killed.
Elena: I know.
Stefan: And what I did, I'm sorry that...I'm sorry that you had to see it.
Elena: I've just never...You were like this other person. And it's my fault. I made you...
Stefan: What? No. no. no. no. You didn't make me do anything. You were saving my life. And I was saving yours.  Everything's gonna be okay.


Elena : Hey, Jer...What--what's going on? Oh, no.
Donovan Residence


Caroline: I made you some coffee.
Matt: Thanks.
Caroline: Are you...is there anything I can do?
Matt: I just, uh...I need to be alone right now.


Elena: Matt...
Mystic Grill


Damon: That was fun. Oh, don't look at me like that. I know you hate me. Guess what? Everyone hates me. But you can't deny it. We were bad ass.


Damon: Uhh. Happens.
Gilbert Residence


Elena: Jer...Are you okay?
Jeremy: I'm gonna go get some sleep.


Anna: What are you doing?
Jeremy: My...my friend Vicki...She's, She's dead.
Anna: Vicki? The one you thought was a...
Jeremy: Yep. Turns out she's been dead all along.
Anna: She's the reason you wanted to turn? You wanted to be with her?


Jeremy: Look, I'm sorry.


Salvatore Boarding House


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Could you turn it up a little bit? It's not annoying yet.
Stefan: Sorry.


Damon: When are you going back to school?
Stefan: Soon.


Damon: Oh come on. Just drink already. Come on, this self-detox is not natural.


Stefan: Can you get that away from me please?
Damon: How long did it take you to wean yourself of it the last time you indulged?


Damon: That's not good.
Stefan: I'll be fine; it just takes a little bit of time.
Damon: I don't get it; you know, you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for. I haven't hunted in a human in...God way too long.
Stefan: Oh, I'm impressed.
Damon: It's completely self-serving. I'm trying to get the town off the trail of vampires which is not very easy considering that there is an entire tomb of them running around.
Stefan: What are we planning on doing about that?
Damon: We are not going to do much of anything if you don't have your strength. There's nothing wrong with partaking in a healthy diet of human blood from a blood bank. You're not actually killing anyone.
Stefan: I have my reasons.
Damon: Well, what are those holier-than-thou reasons? You know, we never actually discussed this. You know, I'd- I'd love to hear this story.


Stefan: You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Watching me struggle?
Damon: Very much so.
Stefan: I hate to break it to you Damon but...I actually have it under complete control.
Damon: You do? Well, then you should just carry on, making the rest of us vampires look bad.


Damon: Have a great day, Stefan.


Damon: Oh, hey, almost forgot something. Oops.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Come on Jeremy, going to school! Walking out the door now!
Jenna: Forgot this. 
Elena: Thank you.


John : Elena!
Elena: Uncle John! Hi.
John : Jenna.
Jenna: John, you made it.
John: I said I'll be here before noon.


Jenna: Oh what you say and what you do are typically two very different things.


Jeremy: Uncle John, what's up?
John: Hey!


John: I had some business in town; I thought that a visit was in order.
Elena: How long are you staying?
John: I don't know yet.
Elena: Okay, well, I'm gonna go to school, I'll see you later.


John: So what's up with Jeremy?
Jenna: He just lost a friend, so try to be sensitive.
John : I'm always sensitive.
Jenna: Right, so really how long are you staying?
John: Can you at least pretend that you're happy to see me?
Jenna : No, I can't.
John: Do you really think that I was just gonna sign the escrow papers and send them back?
Jenna: Actually I did.
John: I'm not going to let you sell my brother's office.
Jenna: It's not up to you or me; it belongs to Jeremy and Elena.
John: Yeah but they're minors, so I get the final say, being that I'm the estate's trustee.
Mystic Falls High School


Elena: He said his trip is open ended.
Matt: Uncle John, I never really liked that guy.
Elena: Does anyone?
Matt: I'm here for moral support if you need me.
Elena: Thanks, I think I'll suffer this one alone; you've been through enough.
Matt: Thank you by the way, for just...for everything you did at Vicki's funeral and the memorial. I couldn't have done it without you.
Elena: Of course Matt.


Elena: So, was Caroline still baking for you guys, around the clock?
Matt: She finally went to her dad, which is a good thing because my mom was going to strangle her if she dropped off one more lasagna.




Jeremy: Nah.
Tyler: What's your problem?
Jeremy: I just don't want any.
Tyler: All right. They say she OD'd.
Jeremy: That's what I don't get, she was doing okay.
Tyler: Apparently not.
Jeremy: How did she end up buried in the woods? That's what I don't understand.
Tyler: By whoever was with her when she OD'd.
Jeremy: Yeah but you leave her, you don't take the time to bury her.
Tyler: Maybe she saw something and...Hell man, I don't know.
Founders' Hall


Sheriff Forbes: The coroner's office has officially ruled Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose. Her family has been notified, the truth will stay in this room and we can put this behind us.
Mayor Lockwood: Thank you Sheriff. And on to a more pressing issue, John Gilbert has asked to say a few words.


Mayor Lockwood: Welcome back John, it's good to see you.
John: Hello everyone, it's wonderful to see you, I wish it were under better circumstances. As a founding family member I find it's my duty to report some very distressing news.


Damon: He's a Gilbert?
Sheriff Forbes: Elena's uncle. His name is John but I call him Jackass.
John: A hospital blood bank in the neighboring county of Amherst has reported several break ins over the past two weeks. 7 hunters, 4 campers and 2 states employees have been reported missing as well. All of this within a 75-mile radius of Mystic Falls.


Mayor Lockwood: Okay okay, no need to get alarmed right at this moment.
Sheriff Forbes : Meaning he doesn't want to cancel the Founders' Day Kick-off Party.
John: You think all of your problems are over but I'm here to tell you, nothing's been solved.


Mystic Falls High School


Alaric: I made a copy of a paper Jeremy wrote for me. I think you should take a look at it.


Elena: Jeremy wrote this?
Alaric: He's very clear that he didn't think it was real.
Elena: I really hope you're right because I've done so much to protect him from all of this.


Alaric: So, how do you deal with it?
Elena: What do you mean?
Alaric: With all the lies and the secrets. You have to lie to everyone who's important to you.
Elena: It's not safe for them to know the truth. So, yes I keep it from them, but it's only because I love them.


Alaric: I think Stefan is a good guy. But at the end of the day he's still a vampire.
Elena: I know it's hard to understand but Stefan is different. He would never do anything to hurt me.
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: I've no interest in the Founders' Day Kick-off Party.
John: Sure you do its tradition.
Jenna: It will be our role to break the tradition.
John: The Gilberts have been a part of this town for a hundred and fifty years. We're one of the founding families and with that distinction comes certain obligations including going to the party. One day, when you can appreciate the significance, I'll tell you all about your heritage.
Jenna: Hmm, the Gilbert family legacy. I forgot how sacred it was. I'm not a Gilbert so I was never cool enough to hear it.
Jeremy : Why does she hate you?
John: We used to sleep together.


Jenna: I'm standing right here.


Elena: Why would he write a report on vampires? Do you think he's starting to remember?
Stefan: Damon took away those memories for good, you don't have to worry about that. I tell you what: why don't you just ask him?
Elena: I...I can't.
Stefan: Why not? I mean if he doesn't know anything then it's just an innocent question.
Elena: I don't even know how to talk to him anymore. I mean, we used to be a lot more open with each other. But now, with all these secrets just piling up...You know, I haven't even told him that I am adopted yet.
Stefan: Maybe it's time you start opening up to him. I'm not saying you should tell him everything but at least try to find out what he does know and be prepared for it.


Elena: What about you, how are you doing?
Stefan: Much, much better. I'm still, you know...a little jittery, a little bit on edge but I'm gonna be okay.
Elena: I've been really worried about you and I missed you.
Stefan: I just needed to lay low for a little while and let my body readjust. It's only been a few days.
Elena: It feels like a lifetime.


Stefan: I've missed you too.


Elena: Stefan, what's wrong? Stefan?




Elena: Oh good you're here.
Damon: You ask I come. I'm easy like that.


Damon : No Elena, I will not go to your bedroom with you.


Damon: Ah, just like I remember.
Elena: Stop messing around.


Damon: Did you know that your uncle has been kicking it with the Founders' Council?
Elena: What?
Damon: Yep.
Elena: Perfect, we'll just add it to the growing list of how everything is falling apart.


Damon: What happened right there?
Elena: Uh...nothing.


Elena: Look Damon, I'm worried about Stefan. He says that everything's okay but he's clearly struggling. How long is it gonna take before he goes back to normal?
Damon: A few days, give or take.
Elena: It's been a few days.
Damon: Give then, I don't know. What's the big deal?


Elena: He's not himself, Damon.


Damon: Well, maybe his problem is that he has spent too long not being himself.


Elena: Please don't make me sorry for asking you.


Damon: It is what it is Elena. The Stefan you know was good behavior Stefan, reign it in Stefan, fight against his nature into an annoying excessive level Stefan but if you think there isn't another part to this then you have not been paying attention.


Elena: He's not you, not even close.
Damon: Well, he doesn't want to be me. That doesn't mean that deep down though he's not.


Salvatore Boarding House


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Hey.
Jeremy: What's up?
Elena: Do you have some time to talk?
Jeremy: Uh, yeah, sure.
Elena: Not here. Come on. Let's get out of the house.
Lake


Jeremy: I just can't believe mom and dad never told you that you were adopted.
Elena: I'm sure they would have eventually.
Jeremy: Why were you worried about what I thought?
Elena: Because...I don't know. It's weird. Going you're whole life thinking you're related by blood to someone.
Jeremy: Does it bug you that we're not?
Elena: No, Jer...you're my brother, that's all that matters.


Elena: So, Mr. Saltzman said you've been doing great in history now.
Jeremy: Yeah, yeah he's really been helping me out. He gave me some extra credit and stuff.
Elena: He loved your vampire paper.
Jeremy: He thought I had a clever angle.
Elena: What drew you to that subject matter?
Jeremy: I don't know, boredom or maybe I'm just as nuts as the long line of Gilbert crazies.
Elena: Gilberts aren't crazy.
Jeremy: Easy for you to say, you're not one.


Elena: Ouch.


Founders' Hall




Stefan: Oh god! I shouldn't be here.
Damon: Come on, don't be a downer, it's a party for the founding families! That would be us. That would be rude to skip it.
Stefan: I really liked you a whole lot better when you hated everybody.
Damon: Oh I still do. I just love that they love me.


Damon: How are you feeling?
Stefan: I'm good, I'm fine.
Damon: No cravings? No urges? Is that whiskey you've been drinking all day doing its job?


Damon: We are who we are Stefan. Nothing's gonna change that.
Stefan: Ah! Nothing will make you happier to just see me given up hein Damon?
Damon: Whatever, it's inevitable.
Stefan: Well, I'm gonna find Elena.


Damon: Don't embarrass me young man!




Mayor Lockwood: I'm so glad you could join us tonight.
Kelly: It was nice of you to reach out to us.
Mayor Lockwood: This town is one big family, when we lose a member we all have to come together.


Mayor Lockwood: Matt.
Matt: Mayor.


Kelly: Well I guess dead kid rates a special greeting from the mayor, huh?
Matt: God, mom!
Kelly: I need a drink.


Tyler: Check it out!
Matt: Your dad is going to beat you down if he catches you.
Tyler: Yeah. Let him try.
Matt: Screw it.




Elena: Hey!
Stefan: Hey. How are you?


Elena: Are you drunk?
Stefan: Okay, I know it's a little weird but it's really helping me. The alcohol takes the edge off.
Elena: You're totally that drunk high school guy at parties sneaking booze.
Stefan: I totally am, yeah.
Elena: How worried do I need to be?
Stefan: Oh no! You don't need to be worried. It's just until the cravings go away. Listen, I think we should enjoy it while it lasts. Would you like to dance with me?
Elena: You hate dancing. I usually have to beg you.
Stefan: No, no, no you have to beg the sober me. The drunk me there is no begging necessary.


Elena: There's really no one dancing.
Stefan: That's because they need something better to dance to. I'll be right back.


Kelly: Yeah...That's not gonna work. I already tried to bribe the guy with 20 bucks and a date. He said Carol Lockwood has complete control over the music choices.


Elena: You'd be surprised what Stefan can accomplish when he puts his mind to it.


Kelly: Thank God!


Damon: Have I entered an alternate universe where Stefan is fun?
Elena: Is he gonna be okay?
Damon: Eventually. One way or another.




Elena: History teacher three o'clock.
Jenna: How do I look?
Elena: Beautiful.


Alaric : I was looking for you.
Jenna: Here I am. I haven't seen you in a while.
Alaric: Well uh... Things have been a little crazy but I'm here now. Do you want to get a drink?
Jenna: Sure.
Alaric: Okay.


Matt: When did this happen?
Elena: DJ had a change of heart.
Matt: Do you want to dance?
Elena: I don't know.
Matt: Yes.
Elena: Matt!




Damon: You know I love a woman in uniform but I have to side with this one. You look...you look smashing.


Sheriff Forbes: Thank you Damon. Cheers!  I needed that. You know I had my doubts about you at first but like everyone else on the council you've won me over.
Damon: Thanks Liz. It's really nice how welcoming the council has been. I like my life here in Mystic Falls. Starting to feel like home again.
Sheriff Forbes: Well, you're not gonna like what I have to tell you. Johnathan Gilbert's claims check out. Blood bank, the missing people, all of it's true. We might have a problem.


Jeremy: Excuse me Sheriff. I was curious if there's been any more information about what happened to Vicki Donovan?
Sheriff Forbes: It was an overdose, Jeremy.
Jeremy: Yeah, but her body was buried. Somebody must have done that.


Sheriff Forbes: We're aware of that. The investigation is ongoing but there's nothing more I can tell you at this time. I'm sorry.
Jeremy: It's okay.


Stefan: Please dance with your alcoholic vampire boyfriend.


Man: Wow! Watch it!
Elena: I'm sorry, my fault. I'm clumsy.
Man: Then get off the dance floor.
Elena: Excuse me?
Stefan: That no way to talk to a lady.
Man: Whatever.


Stefan: I think you need to apologize.
Man: I'm sorry.


Stefan: Now say it like you mean it.
Man: I'm really, really sorry.
Elena: Stefan, it's fine.
Stefan: Now walk away.


Stefan:  You alright?




Elena: Have you noticed what your brother has been up to?
Damon: No, I have been too preoccupied with yours.


Damon: Jeremy has been asking questions about Vicki Donovan's death.
Elena: He knows that her death was ruled an overdose.
Damon: Really?  Oh but sheriff, someone buried her. Who would do that? I know I know! Me! I mean I could compel him but he's wearing vervain.
Elena: No, I don't want you to compel him.
Damon: If he keeps asking questions...
Elena: Damon, no I'm serious. I'm not going to do that to him again. I'll handle it.


Damon: Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you.




Tyler: I saw that.
Kelly: Shh! We'll keep that between you and me. Where is the ladies' room?
Tyler: This way, I'll show you.
Kelly : Is that soda?
Tyler: Um...


Kelly: Vodka. Thank god!


John: Damon, right?
Damon: John.
John: We didn't get the chance to meet at the council meeting.
Damon: Yeah. It's a pleasure. Are you enjoying the kick-off?
John: Oh yeah. I forgot how much fun these small town celebrations can be.
Damon: Yeah. When was the last time you were here?
John: Hasn't been that long, my brother's funeral. How long have you been in town?
Damon: Oh, not long at all.
John: So what do you think Damon? You know this vampire problem is real, right? It's a potential blood bath.
Damon: I wouldn't overreact John.
John: Oh, I think it's like 1864 all over again, vampires running amok. I guess we're just gonna have to hunt them down, throw them in a church and burn them to ash.
Damon: That's the story, huh?
John: Part of the story, yeah.
Damon: Oh, there's more?
John: Oh, there's a lot more. See, it seems there was a tomb under the church, where vampires were hidden, waiting for someone to come along and set them free. But then you already knew that didn't you?


John: I mean, you're the one that did it.
Damon: And you're telling me this why?
John: I just thought we get the introductions out of the way.
Damon: You know that I could rip your throat out before anyone would notice?
John: Yeah.
Damon: Yeah, okay. But you probably ingest vervain so...
John: Why don't you take a bite to find out?
Damon : It's not worth my time.




Elena: Jer? I heard about your conversation with Sheriff Forbes.
Jeremy: No one is trying to figure out what happened to her. They all want to believe that she OD'd.
Elena: The coroner's office confirmed it. If that's what they said happened then...
Jeremy: Is that what you believe?
Elena: What do you think happened?
Jeremy: I think somebody killed her and buried her body and I don't think we should write it off just cause it's easy.
Elena: They're just doing what they can to move on.
Jeremy: The truth is the only thing that's gonna help people to move on.
Elena: Jer, just let it go, okay? Whatever it was she's gone now.
Jeremy: Whatever it was? So you don't think it was an overdose?
Elena: Yes...I do.
Jeremy: Is there something you're not telling me?


Jeremy: Why aren't you looking at me?
Elena: Stop it, that doesn't mean anything.
Jeremy: If there was something else you would tell me, right?


Elena: Of course I would.




Kelly: Oh god! I can't even walk.
Tyler: I know, me neither.
Kelly: Oh my god, Matt is going to kill me.
Tyler: He won't even notice. I think he's actually letting himself have some fun for once.
Kelly: Yeah, I know I just should be on my best behavior because of Vicki but I don't want to think about it. I can't, because if I do...
Tyler: Yeah, I was a dick to her, I was really bad. That's what I hate is I can't make any of it right. It's like I don't deserve to even miss her.


Kelly: You're nice to talk to me. I don't have anyone to talk to.


Tyler: I don't have anyone to talk to either.




Matt: Who knew I've been missing all the fun at the Founders' parties?
Elena: This is rare, believe me.
Matt: Is it bad that I'm enjoying myself?
Elena: No, it's great that you are enjoying yourself. Thanks for making me dance.
Matt: Hey, it's normal.


Matt: Air, I need some air. Come with me?


Elena: Sure.
Matt: You haven't seen my mom have you?
Elena: No, not in a while.


Elena: Oh my god.


Matt: What the hell are you doing man?
Kelly: Matt?!
Matt : Mom!!!!
Tyler: Whoa dude calm down.


Elena: Matt! Stop it! Tyler! Stop it, you're hurting him! Somebody help us.


Alaric: What the hell is that?


Mayor Lockwood: I'll take it from here; I'll take it from here : Are you hurt? Go get cleaned up. It's okay. Go get cleaned up.


Mayor Lockwood : Thank you for your help.


Mayor Lockwood : Everything's fine. Everything is fine. Come on, everybody, back to the party. Let's go. Come on, have a good time!


Elena: Are you okay?
Matt: Where is she?
Elena: I don't know. Put your head up.




Damon: You wanna hear the bad news or the really bad news?
Stefan: Actually, I don't want any news Damon.
Damon: Alright, let me rephrase. Do you want to hear how the council is back in vampire mode or how I just killed Uncle John Gilbert?
Stefan: What?
Damon: Great party by the way, huh?


Stefan: Damon.


Stefan: Is everything alright?
Kelly: No. I ruined it, I always ruin it. What is wrong with me?


Kelly: What are you doing?


Stefan: Uh, I'm sorry.




Damon: You got to be kidding me.


Mayor Lockwood: Thank you all, thank you very much, thank you. Thank you all for joining us tonight in just a few moments we will officially begin the countdown to our upcoming Founders' Day celebration and it's a very special one this year. The one hundred and fiftieth birthday of our town.


Mayor Lockwood: And...and I would like to welcome back one of our town favorite's sons to do the honors of ringing our official charter bell. John Gilbert, would you please join me up here?


John: One hundred and fifty years of community, prosperity, family. We take care of each other, we look after each other, protect each other  It's good to be home.


Damon: Look at his right hand.
Alaric: Whose?
Damon: Towns favorite's son. Look at his ring.


Alaric: Well, it looks like mine.
Damon: Yeah, and that would be a big coincidence if he didn't just came back from the dead five minutes ago. Where the hell did you get that ring?
Alaric: Isobel, my wife.
Damon: Who gave birth to Elena, under the medical care of the esteemed DR Grayson Gilbert, John's brother!


Alaric: Do you think John knew Isobel?
Damon: I think John knows a lot of things.


Man: Sorry about that man. I really am terribly sorry.
Stefan: You don't want to do this man.


Man: I'm sorry about that too. All I can do is apologize. What's that about?
Stefan: Get out of my way. Please.
Man: No girl to show off for now? I see what how this is.


Man: What are you, man?
Gilbert Residence


Founders' Hall


Elena: Stefan? Stefan?  Hey! Are you okay? What happened?


Man: My arm. I lost my balance and fell. I'm clumsy.


Mayor Lockwood: Let's go.
Tyler: Dad, I'm sorry. I don't even know what happened. I was drinking and...I lost control. I can't explain it.


Mayor Lockwood: That is the last time you ever embarrass this family.
Donovan Residence


Kelly: What are you doing? Matt don't.
Matt: I can't do it anymore mom so just go alright? You've done it before. More times than I can count.
Kelly: I'm not leaving you. Matty!
Matt : Mom!!! Don't you get it? I'm better off without you.


Kelly: No, tonight was...God, I'm so sorry. I know I failed you and I failed Vicki but I won't do it to you again. I promise I'll get it together.
Matt: I want you out of the house and my life by morning.


Founders' Hall


Damon: Going somewhere, hm?
John: I've never liked to be the last one to leave a party. It's too desperate. You're going to kill me again or you're gonna let Mr. Saltzman do your dirty work?
Alaric: Okay, you obviously know who I am.
John: I do. Alaric Saltzman, a high school history teacher with a secret.
Damon: Sure know a lot for someone who just got to town.
John: More than you can imagine, Damon. My knowledge of this town goes beyond anything that you  or the council knows. So, if you're planning on some clever high speed snatch ring vamp kill move, know that if I die, everything I know goes to the council including the fascinating little tale of the originals Salvatore brothers and their present day return to Mystic Falls.


Alaric: How did you get that ring?
John: I had inherited one, my brother Gray had the other. This was his  and I wouldn't have given mine to Isobel if I had known she'd hand it over to another guy.
Damon: So you did know her?
John: Who do you think send her your way when she wanted to become a vampire?
Damon: You sent her?
John: Guilty. Why, did you think someone else send her? Maybe Katherine Pierce?
Damon: How do you know about Katherine?
John: How do I know anything Damon?
Damon: What do you want?
John: So many questions. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ric. I've heard so much about you.


Gilbert Residence


Jenna: Not so excited that we have another month of these Founders' Day events.
Elena: Tell me about it.


Elena: Are you okay?
Jeremy: Fine.
Elena: Are you sure?
Jeremy: I'm fine Elena.


Elena: Oh my god you scared me!
Stefan: Sorry. I'm sorry that I ran off earlier.
Elena: What happened? Is everything okay?
Stefan: Uh, no.
Elena: Talk to me.


Elena: Stefan, tell me.
Stefan: I tried so hard to keep it together tonight and it was working, it was working but then Matt's mom, she got hurt and she was bleeding and I had her blood on my hands.
Elena: And then what happened?
Stefan: And then that guy in the parking lot, I wanted to feed on him and it took everything inside of me not to do it.
Elena: But you didn't?
Stefan: No, but I wanted to. Elena, my head is pounding. I feel like my skin is on fire. I have this hunger inside of me that I've never felt before in my entire life and all I keep thinking about is how I promised that I would never keep anything from you, and so I'm telling you this.
Elena: That's okay; I need you to tell me these things.
Stefan: But I don't want you to see me like this, I don't want you to know that this side of me exists.
Elena: Stefan, you're gonna get through this. I'm gonna help you pull through. It's gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay.


Stefan: No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, I can't, I'm afraid of what I could do to you.
Elena: I'm not.


Elena: Stefan, I'm not.


Elena: I'm not, okay?


Stefan: I love you so much.
Elena: I love you too.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: We have a problem Stefan and when I say problem I mean global crisis. It seems Uncle John has...


Damon: You don't look so good. Its different this time, isn't it? The need is too strong. Of course it would be after all these years.


Damon: Have a good night brother.


Mystic Falls High School


Elena: Nice car.
Stefan: Thought it was a waste to leave it in the garage.


Elena: I didn't know you were coming back today.
Stefan: You know, I woke up this morning and I was feeling great and I figured it was time for me to get back into things.
Elena: Does that mean you're okay now, with all the cravings?
Stefan: Yeah, I mean the worst part is over so...now all I want to do is just spend as much time with you as possible.
Elena: I'm okay with that.


Stefan: Hey, thank you for helping me get through the rough patch.
Elena: You're welcome . We're gonna be late.
Stefan: Okay, uh, you know what? I'll catch up with you, I'm gonna grab my stuff. I'll be right behind you.
Elena: Okay.


Founders Hall


Sheriff Forbes: There was a disturbance at the hospital blood bank last night; some of the supply was compromised.
Damon: Compromised? You mean stolen?
Sheriff Forbes: We almost missed it. The inventory records were altered but when the night manager was questioned he had no recollection of changing them.
John: Meaning that the vampire who stole the blood used mind control to hide the theft.
Damon : I know what you meant.
Sheriff Forbes: We wouldn't have noticed had John not alerted us to recent discrepancies in other hospital blood banks in the county.
Damon: How lucky for us, we have John.


Sheriff Forbes: We're stepping up security at the hospital, giving the guard vervain to prevent this from happening again.
John: Sheriff, may I offer a suggestion? Why don't Damon and I put our heads together? We can track down whoever is doing this.
Sheriff Forbes: Truthfully I can use the extra hands. Is that something you would be willing to do?
Damon: Well, of course, I mean if it'll help.
John: I think we could make a good team, don't you think Damon?


Damon: John, whatever I can do to help keep this town safe; even if it means spending time with you.


Mystic Falls High School


Alaric: Okay, this week we're gonna set outside our regular curriculum for a lesson in local history as we approach Founders' Day. Apparently the community leaders feels it's more important than World War 2 but hey what do I know?


Bonnie: Sorry I'm late.
Alaric: Well, it looks like we will be at full occupancy today. Welcome home, Bonnie.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: I suppose I should be grateful, you learned how to use the bell.
Anna: I'm here on behalf of my mother.


Damon: On behalf of or in spite of?
Anna: I'm sorry about what the other vampires did to Stefan. Abducting him, torturing him...It wasn't supposed to go down like that.
Damon: You're playing house with half of a tomb of really pissed off vampires. What do you think was going to happen?
Anna: My mom is devastated; they tried to over throw her.
Damon: Why isn't she here telling me this?
Anna: She doesn't really do apologies.
Damon: Well, it's a coincidence, cause I don't do forgiveness. Just run along. And if you're going continue playing house with these little vampires pets, you might wanna stop robbing the blood bank dry because they're onto it.
Anna: I haven't been to the local blood bank in at least a week.
Damon: Then it's one of your others.
Anna: The others are gone, Damon.
Damon: Well, where did they go?
Anna: They weren't cut out for this town. After what happened with your brother my mom kicked them out and they took off. It's just us and Harper now.
Mystic Falls High School


Elena: Bonnie!
Bonnie: Hey.
Elena: Hey, I tried to grab you after class but you already taken off. How are you? How's your family?
Bonnie: We're dealing, it's been hard.
Elena: Everyone here really missed you.
Bonnie: Yeah, I just had so much to deal with after Grams' funeral and, honestly after you told me the tomb spell failed I just didn't really want to come back.
Elena: I hope that you understand why I called...I wanted you to know before you came home.
Bonnie: I understand why. I just...shouldn't know.


Elena: I know it's been really hard...


Caroline: Bonnie! Bonnie! Thank god you're home!


Caroline: I know we talked everyday but I missed you.


Caroline: How are you doing?
Bonnie: Better. Better. You know, glad to be back and trying to keep myself busy.
Caroline: Well, I can help with that. Major wardrobe problem. You need to help me pick up the perfect dress for the Founders' court.
Elena: The Founders' court? Did I miss something?
Caroline: The Founders' court! You know, Miss Mystic Falls. They announced it today and you and I are both on it.
Elena: Oh my god! We signed up for that so long ago...I completely forgot.
Caroline: So, are you dropping out then?
Elena: I can't.


Caroline: No?
Bonnie: Her mom is the one who wanted her to enter.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: How was school?
Stefan: Fine.
Damon: Yeah? Same old, same old? Nothing new? No stories to bring home?
Stefan: You're making small talk, why?
Damon: You seem awfully chipper lately, less doom and gloom, a little more pep in your step.
Stefan: And you think it's because I drank human blood again.
Damon: I don't want to brag but I would definitely take responsibility for this new and improved you.
Stefan: Well, I hate to burst your bubble but I'm clean.
Damon: Yeah, not possible.
Stefan: Not only isn't possible but it is quite true.
Damon: Stefan, just be serious for a second. You spent the last century and a half being a poster child for Prozac and now you expect me to believe that this new you has nothing to do with human blood. Nothing.
Stefan: I'm clean.
Damon: You're lying!
Stefan: Believe what you want.


Gilbert Residence and Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: I'm sorry for the short notice; I didn't even know that the contest was coming up much less that I would be in it.
Stefan: I will be happy to escort you anyway.
Elena: My mom was really into this Founders' day stuff. She was even Miss Mystic in her day. I kind of want to do it for her.
Stefan: It'll be great, we'll have fun.
Elena: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow, I love you.
Stefan: I love you too.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Well well, he's a liar and a thief. So, when were you gonna share?
Stefan: Go ahead, help yourself.
Damon: No, no, no I'm talking about the fact that you're a closet blood junkie.
Stefan: So, I'm drinking blood again. You're the one that shoved it on me, what's your problem? I have it under control.
Damon: Under control? You robbed the hospital!
Stefan: So, what's your point?
Damon: Fine, whatever man, drink up. Just remember, we're trying to keep a low profile. Why don't you just walk up to Sheriff Forbes and ask her to tap a vein?
Stefan: Have my actions negatively impacted you? I can't imagine what that must feel like.
Damon: Yeah, what's Elena thinks about the new...you?
Stefan: Nothing's changed; I'm still the same person.
Damon: Clearly.
Stefan: Elena doesn't need to know anything yet.
Damon: You've been off the human stuff for years, Stefan. If you're having trouble controlling...
Stefan: I'm not having trouble.
Damon: Who do you think you're talking to? I know what it's like. That Jekyll and Hyde feeling, that switch, sometimes it goes off and you snap. Right now is not a good time for me to be worried about you snapping.
Stefan: I know that it pains you to see this but I'm fine, okay? I'm fine.


Stefan: So please, do me a favor and back off.


Founders Hall


Carol: This year's queen will have the special honor of taking stage at the hundred and fiftieth Founders' Day Gala. Before we crown our winner, we'd like to get to know a bit more about each of you.


Caroline: I'm on the Mystic Falls beautification committee; I volunteer at the poor soup kitchen.
Elena: I recognize that I haven't been as involved this year that I used to be.
Caroline: I implemented this year's go green campaign at school.
Elena: I've been distracted and I let a lot of things slide.
Girl: I don't think it's wrong for me to win two years in a row.
Amber: I was surprised to have been selected since I'm not from one of the founding families.
Elena: But I'm aware of what an honor this is and I want you to know that I take it seriously.
Caroline: I worked for the recycling program and was in charge of this year's police raffle.
Tina: Just because my D.U.I. made my community service mandatory doesn't mean that I was any less committed.
Elena: This was really important to my mother. She believed in community, family, honor and loyalty. It's the legacy she left for me.
Salvatore Boarding House


John: Hey partner!
Damon: What do you want?
John: You haven't return any of my calls.
Damon: Most people take that as a hint.
John: Where do we start looking for vampires?
Damon: How do you act John? You obviously don't care about catching vampires, you're here talking to me.
John: Actually, I care very much.
Damon: What Isobel say about that? I mean, considering that she is one.
John: Isobel and I share a mutual interest. The original Jonathan Gilbert has an invention that was stolen by a vampire. That vampire was then burned alive in Fell's church, or so Jonathan thought and the invention was lost forever. But then the vampires weren't killed, were they? They were trapped and now they're free, thanks to you which means the invention is retrieval.
Damon: What is it?
John: The only thing that matters is that I want it back and you're going to help me if you want your secret safe.
Damon: Why bring me into it John? I mean, I don't know what you are talking about much less who has it.
John: Oh come on Damon! You were around back then, you know who these people are, what they look like. He was friendly with a woman who turned out to be a vampire. Her name was Pearl. Does that ring a bell?


Damon: I'm not playing anymore. Get out. Get out.
John: I beg your pardon?
Damon: You know, I only entertain this whole blackmail scheme thing of yours because I thought that you and Isobel could lead me to Katherine but see, now I know you've no idea where Katherine is, because if you did you would know that Katherine and Pearl were best friends. See, you don't know everything, do you John?
John: I'll tell the entire council what you are.
Damon: Go for it! I'll kill every last one of them. Then I'll sever your hand, pull your ring off, and I'll kill you too. Do you understand that?
Mystic Falls High School


Carol: Honor your partner. Stay focus, right hand around. Flirt with your eyes  Left hand around.
Elena: This is ridiculous.
Carol: Both hands.
Stefan: You're only saying that because you don't know how to do it.
Elena: Sorry. Only one of us was around when the dance was invented.
Stefan: Ouch!


Elena: Woah!
Mrs Lockwood: No! No! There's no touching during this part. It's about the simple intimacy of the near touch. Very nice, Amber!
Amber: Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood!
Stefan: If you ask me, the 'near touch' is overrated.
Elena: You seem to be in a good mood.
Stefan: Is that a bad thing? Would you prefer me to be brooding and tortured?
Elena: Hey, I'm not complaining.


Stefan: Oh, no touching!




Caroline: The Fell cousins don't have a shot and Amber Bradley is only on the court so the pageant doesn't look like its founding families only, which of course it is. So that leaves Elena which totally has the sympathy vote since her parents died. How can I compete with that?
Bonnie: Very nice, very sensitive.
Caroline: Oh I'm sorry, this must sound really unimportant. In light of everything.
Bonnie: It's okay, I get it, you want to win.
Caroline: Well, my grandmother was Miss Mystic and both of my aunts. My mom is the only one who didn't get the gene and I want this. I actually deserve this.


Elena: Bonnie. Hey.
Stefan: Hey, how are you?


Caroline: I begged Bonnie to fill in for Matt, he had to work today.


Elena: Bonnie, do you have a minute?
Bonnie: We only have 30 minutes for rehearsal.
Elena: It'll only take a minute, please?


Elena: Bonnie, you have to tell me what's wrong.
Bonnie: It not worth talking about.
Elena: What do you mean not worth it? You barely said ten words to me and you won't even look at Stefan. Is that what it is? Is it Stefan?
Bonnie: Listen, Elena, I can't just pretend that everything's okay. Everything my Grams did was to protect us from those vampires in the tomb. And now they're out which means she died for nothing.
Elena: I'm so sorry Bonnie. What can I do to make it better?
Bonnie: That's just did, there's nothing you can do. I blame him, Elena, him and Damon and I'm not gonna put you in a situation where you have to choose sides. I'm just having a hard time with it, okay?




Alaric: Stefan! Are you okay?
Stefan: Yes, I'm sorry. I was just...I was feeling a little sick.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Hey.
Alaric: Hi.
Elena: I heard you're driving.
Alaric: Yeah I am. Let me get that for you.


Elena: Thanks.


Alaric: How...how is Stefan?
Elena: What do you mean?
Alaric: You know, he seems on edge.
Elena: He went through a lot, he was in bad shape for a while but he's bouncing back now.


John: Alaric. Hey buddy, what are you doing here?
Alaric: I'm the chauffeur.
John: I thought I was driving.


Jenna: No need, we're going with Rick.
Elena: Are we ready?
Jenna: Jeremy can ride with you.
Founders Hall


Damon: In the running for Miss Mystic Falls?
Anna: Sometimes you have to wear uncomfortable heels to blend in. I remember this event from 1864, I was supposed to enter before everything happened.
Damon: Ah, nostalgia's a bitch.
Anna: If you're just gonna mock me can you move along please?
Damon: John Gilbert thinks your mom stole an artifact from Jonathan senior back in 1864.
Anna: What are you, his errand boy?
Damon: I don't know what it is but I don't want him to have it.
Anna: I could ask her but you know, you've made it pretty clear that you don't trust us so why should I even bother?
Damon: Because you want to stay in Mystic Falls and John Gilbert's in town, making that impossible. Find out where it is. He leaves, you can buy a welcome mat.


Elena: Thanks for helping me.
Jenna: Don't thank me until you're sure your hair isn't gonna burn off.
Elena: You know I remember when my mom and I were first applying for this, she was so excited.
Jenna: So were you if I recall.
Elena: I was. She just made it sound like so much fun. Lots has changed since then.
Jenna: I hate to break it to you, but its a little late for cold feet.
Elena: I don't have cold feet. I just...I think I'd be enjoying it a lot more if she was here.
Jenna: Well I tell you one thing, your hair would have a better chance if she was.
Elena: Okay, I should go put my dress on. Be careful with that thing, don't hurt anybody.




John: You look miserable.
Jeremy: Are there really a whole month of these events that I'm supposed to show up at?
John: You could fight it if you want but it's part of being a Gilbert.
Jeremy: Yeah, you mentioned you know a lot about the family. You know anything about our ancestor Jonathan Gilbert?
John: Prolific writer, crazy inventor. Why do you ask?
Jeremy: Well, I read his journal.
John: Is that right?
Jeremy: Yeah, I actually found it in all dads' stuff.
John: Well, it's surprising. Most of them are locked away.
Jeremy: There are more of them?
John: Jonathan Gilbert journaled his whole life. Right down to the bitter, insane, drunken end. He had a lot of demons.
Jeremy: And did you read them?
John: I've browsed, yeah.
Jeremy: What did you think about what he wrote?
John: Crazy ramblings of a mad man, of course.


John: She's very pretty.


Jeremy: Yeah, uh, she's a friend of mine. Excuse me.




Elena: Are you okay, Amber?
Amber: I hate being the center of attention. I get panic attacks.
Elena: Do you need some privacy so you can change?
Amber: Actually I'm just- I'm gonna go get some air.


Elena: Hey, you can't be back here.
Damon: We need to talk.
Elena: Does it have to be right now?
Damon: Normally I would have a completely different outlook of what I'm about to tell you but since it could really inconvenience me, I'll squeal.
Elena: What are you talking about?
Damon: Stefan's still drinking human blood.
Elena: What?!
Damon: Yeah, a month ago I would have rejoiced but with the council back on the alert, it is not a good time for Stefan to fly off the handle.
Elena: I know he's been a little edgy but he said that was normal.
Damon: He has a fridge full of stolen blood bank contraband in the house.


Elena: Oh my god.
Damon: He has no idea what normal is, his entire existence isn't normal. Normal to a vampire is drinking human blood but he spent all this time fighting it when he should have been learning to control it and now it's controlling him instead.
Elena: I can't believe this. I mean, it's Stefan that we're talking about here.
Damon: Stefan on human blood Elena; he'll do anything, he'll say anything because he's not gonna want to stop. Trust me.


Jeremy: Anna!
Anna: What is it?
Jeremy: Come on, don't be like that.
Anna: Why not? You were basically using me to turn you into a vampire so you could be with someone else.
Jeremy: No, I wasn't using you.
Anna: Really? And how would you like to define it?
Jeremy: Look, I don't think it's any worse than you becoming friends with me so you could give your mother my blood.
Anna: How do you know that?
Jeremy: It's not important.
Anna: Seriously, Jeremy. What do you know?
Jeremy: Everything. I know everything.


Elena: This is all my fault; I'm the one who fed him the blood in the first place.


Stefan: What's going on in here?
Damon: I was just filling Elena on your extra-curricular activities.
Stefan : What are you talking about?
Elena: I know about the blood, Stefan.
Damon: I'm uh - I'll be downstairs, drinking.


Stefan: I was going to tell you.
Elena: When?
Stefan: I'm fine. I'm fine, the blood, it doesn't change anything.
Elena: It's changing you.
Stefan: Why? Because I kept it a secret from you? Come on Elena, look, giving the way you're reacting right now, can you really blame me for doing that?
Elena: Are you hearing yourself right now? You've been stealing blood and lying and you say that everything's fine? Everything's not fine, Stefan!
Stefan: So what - so you and Damon all of a sudden have everything figured out then?
Elena: Its not about Damon. It's about what's happening to you.
Stefan: I know and I'm telling you that I'm fine. I'm fine. Please, come on. Elena I thought you...I thought you believed in me.


Carol: Elena, let's go. The line-up's starting.
Elena: I just...I need a minute.
Carol: You're not even dressed yet. Escorts wait downstairs, Stefan.




Amber: Oh God, sorry!




Mayor Lockwood: Miss Tina Fell, escorted by Bartholomew Whitmore.


Carol: Has anyone seen Amber?
Elena : Do you see Stefan down there?


Caroline: Nope, just my boring fill in escort.
Elena: What happened to Matt?
Caroline: They wouldn't let him out of work. Wait, what happened to Stefan?
Elena: I don't know, he just disappeared somewhere, I don't know. What am I doing? I never should have gone through with this.
Caroline: What do you mean?
Elena: I need to find Stefan, this isn't me, I'm not this person anymore.
Caroline: No, no, no way, no. You had your chance to drop out and believe me I was all for it because there is no way that I could beat you. Elena, you're doing this because it was important to your mom.
Mayor Lockwood: Miss Caroline Forbes and her escort Jeffrey Lockwood Hamilton.


Carol: Elena, you're next.


Anna: You're missing Elena's introduction.
Jeremy: I don't care.
Anna: So, she has no idea you read her journal?
Jeremy: She keeps things from me, I'm gonna keep things from her.
Anna: What are you gonna do now? Now that you know everything that she's been hiding from you?
Jeremy: I don't know. There's a part of me that's so angry, you know, that she covered up what happened to Vicki and erased my memory but there's also this other part of me that's glad. I...I don't want to remember Vicki like that.
Anna: As a monster?
Jeremy: No, as someone who wanted to hurt me.
Anna: When I met you, you were just a part of my plan to get my mother back but then things changed...All the time we spent together...I would never do anything to hurt you, not now. You know that right?
Jeremy: Yeah I know that.




Amber: Where are we going?
Stefan: I don't know.
Amber: I'm in the ceremony.


Stefan: Not now you're not.


Stefan: You're standing in the parking lot with me.
Amber: I'm in the parking lot with you.
Stefan: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not very good to be around right now, I'm a little bit on the edge. I've been drinking the human stuff and it's really screwing with my head. She knows now. God! She wasn't supposed to found out, I didn't want her to found out, now everything's ruined.
Amber: You seem sad.


Stefan: I'm not sad. I'm freaking hungry!


Mayor Lockwood: Miss Elena Gilbert, escorted by Mister Stefan Salvatore.


Elena:  Where is Stefan?
Damon:  I don't know.


Jenna:  What is she doing with Damon?
Alaric: I have no idea.


Elena:  What are we gonna do?
Damon:  Right now, we just have to get through this.




Stefan: I don't hurt people. I don't do that. I'm the good brother.
Amber: Do you want to hurt me?


Stefan: I want to kill you, I want to rip into your skin and I want to feed on your blood.


Stefan: Under your skin, pulsating, floating.


Stefan: Your carotid artery right here. If you puncture this just right you can control the blood flow. It takes practice but it doesn't have to make a mess, you don't have to waste any.
Amber: What's stopping you?
Stefan : If I do this, if I give in, there's no going back.
Amber: Then don't.
Stefan: I just want one taste; that's all I need, I just want one taste.


Amber: One taste.




Caroline: Where is Amber?
Elena: I don't know.
Mayor Lockwood: Before I crown the winner, I'd like to offer a personal thank you to all of these young ladies for their efforts to better our community.


Mayor Lockwood: So, without further a due it is my honor to announce our very own Miss Mystic Falls, Miss Caroline Forbes!


Elena: Congratulations!
Caroline: I actually won!




John: There is blood on the glass.


Sheriff Forbes: Get me Damon Salvatore.


Stefan: I can't do this.
Amber: What's the matter?
Stefan: I can't do this.
Amber: It's okay, it doesn't hurt that much, just not so hard next time.
Stefan: Oh god oh god oh god! I can't stop.


Stefan: Why aren't you afraid of me?
Amber: You told me not to be.
Stefan: What? What's your name?
Amber: Amber.
Stefan: Listen to me, Amber. I need you to be afraid of me. I need you to run like hell do you understand me? Run, run now!




Elena: What is it, did you find him?
Damon: There were signs of a struggle in the upstairs bathroom.


Damon: There was blood and that Amber girl is missing.
Elena: Oh my god! He wouldn't hurt her, he won't!
Damon: Let's just find him, okay? Let's get your coat come on!




Amber: You said to run!
Stefan: I changed my mind.


Elena: Stefan!


Damon: Stefan, come on get control. It's okay, come on. Breath through it man.


Elena: Stefan stop it!


Damon: It's okay. Stefan.




Sheriff Forbes: She doesn't remember what happened.
Damon: It's a good thing the girls got here when they did, she lost a lot of blood.
Sheriff Forbes : You didn't see anything?


Elena: No, we just found her and then called Damon.
Bonnie: Is she gonna be okay?
Sheriff Forbes: It looks like it yeah. Why don't you girls get back to the party? Damon and I can take it from here.
Elena: Okay.


Sheriff Forbes: They didn't see the bite mark?
Damon: No, I got here before they got too close. There was too much blood, they couldn't see it clearly.




Elena: Bonnie, can we talk about this?
Bonnie: There's nothing to talk about.
Elena: Bonnie, please!
Bonnie: I told you I wasn't gonna make you choose but I need to make the choice for myself. Please just leave me alone.




Jenna: Jer, are you ready?
Jeremy: Just a sec.


John: Who's that girl with Jeremy?
Jenna: His friend, Anna.
John: What's her story?
Jenna: Why so nosy?
John: I'm just curious; he really seems to like her.
Jenna: She's new in town, I think. She and her mom Pearl, the family who you're so rudely trying to prevent from buying Grayson's building.
John : Her mother's name is Pearl?
Jenna: Yes, so?
John: Well, I believe I already know all about her.


Alaric: Good, there you are. Jenna wanted me to get the car.


Alaric: What happened?
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: All right now, this is getting weird.
Anna: We're here to talk.


Damon: Not in the mood, today's been a no good, very bad day.
Pearl: Annabelle tells me you're looking for something I took from Jonathan Gilbert.
Damon: Im listening.


Damon: What is it?
Pearl: Jonathan was passionate about his inventions. He confided in me that he had created a detection device meant to track down the town's vampire element.
Damon: It was a pocket watch.
Pearl: That's what it turned out to be yes. But that's not what I stole. I discovered my mistake when I saw the watch in Jonathan's hand, the night they took us, its stile pointed at me.


Damon: So what is this?
Pearl: I have no idea but now it's yours.
Damon: What's the catch?
Pearl: There is no catch. My daughter wants to stay here. I want to stay here. You refused to trust us and for good reason. Consider this an apology.




Stefan: You shouldn't be here.
Elena: I know.
Stefan: Now you know.
Elena: That wasn't you.
Stefan: Oh, it was absolutely me. A monster, a predator, that's who I am Elena.
Elena: That's what the blood makes you.
Stefan: The blood brings out what's inside of me and if you think any differently then you're an idiot.
Elena: I know this isn't you Stefan.
Stefan: I wanted to drain every ounce of blood from that girl's body.
Elena: No.
Stefan: It's who I am Elena.
Elena: No, you can't scare me off.
Stefan: Why would you risk it? Why would you come here?
Elena: Because I did this, this is my fault; I'm the one who made you drink the blood.
Stefan: All you did was expose me to who I really am.
Elena: This isn't you.
Stefan : Stop saying that!!!


Stefan: Don't get any closer to me.
Elena: I'm not gonna let this happen to you.
Stefan: Stop.
Elena: Stefan, I'm not gonna give up on you! I believe in you!
Stefan: Stop!!!


Stefan: Stop!


Stefan: I'm so sorry.
Elena: It's okay. It's okay.


Stefan: I don't know what's happening to me.
Elena: It's okay, Stefan. Its okay. You're gonna be okay.


Damon: Sure you want to do this?
Elena: I'm sure.


Damon: There's no guarantee it's going to work.
Elena: It has to.
Damon: Coming?
Elena: I'm gonna stay here.


Salvatore Boarding House


Woods 1864


Man: We have to get to the church. They're waiting.
Stefan  Over here! There's another one! Quick! Help me!
Johnathan: Arm yourselves.


Stefan: We don't have long.
Damon: Katherine. Katherine.


Stefan: We're going to get you out of here. Damon, hurry. Hurry.


Stefan: No! No. Damon.
Men: Come on. Let's go.
Stefan: Uhh!


Salvatore Boarding House and Woods 1864


Damon: Stefan. Stefan.
Elena: Stefan.
Katherine and Elena: I love you, Stefan.


Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: It's so hard to see him locked up like this.
Damon: You're the one who locked him up.
Elena: You helped.
Damon: I couldn't have him running around chewing on people. While the town was looking for vampires, now, could I?
Elena: It had nothing to do with you actually caring about him?
Damon: Your thing, not mine.
Quarry 1864


Emily: Katherine had me make that for you weeks ago.
Stefan: Where am I?
Emily: The quarry just north of town. My brother and I brought you here last night. We found you dead in the woods.
Stefan: Where's Damon? Am I...am I a...?
Emily: Not yet. You're in transition.
Stefan: But how? I...
Emily: You had Katherine's blood in your system when you died.
Stefan: No. I never...
Emily: She's been compelling you to drink it for weeks, Stefan.
Stefan: And Damon?
Emily: No compulsion was necessary. He drank from her willingly.


Damon: I woke up last night. I didn't know where I was. I went to the church. And I watched them drag her inside. Then they set fire to it. And the whole church went up into flames. They killed her, Stefan. She's gone.
Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Did you ever figure out what that is?
Damon: Nope. Whatever it is, it doesn't work.
Elena: Pearl didn't say anything else about it?
Damon: She thought she was stealing his vampire compass, but that was a pocket watch. That Johnathan Gilbert was a crazy scientist. Have you spoken to your uncle lately?
Elena: I've been avoiding him, actually. That, and I've been here most nights.
Damon: So, you'll be here again tonight?
Elena: Is that a problem?
Damon: Yes. You're a complete nuisance.
Elena: Heh. See you later.
Mystic Falls High School


Anna: Hey. Surprise.
Jeremy: What are you doing here?
Anna: Picking up this.
Jeremy: A class schedule?
Anna: Starting tomorrow, I'm officially a student here.
Jeremy: You're kidding me, right?
Anna: No. I finally beat my mom down.
Jeremy: Heh. But why would you want to go to high school? It blows.
Anna: Do I really need to answer that?
Jeremy: You'd suffer through all this just to hang out with me?
Anna: Yeah. I would.
Jeremy: That's, um...
Anna: Stupid? Pathetic? Old lurky me?
Jeremy: It's awesome. It's awesome.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Brought you something to eat...100 percent Stefan diet approved. You know what will happen if you don't eat. You'll get all rotting and crusty.
Stefan: I'm not hungry.
Damon: Of course you are. We're eternally hungry. Take it. The human blood should be gone by now. You want to explain why you're still in here. Feeling sorry for yourself? Come on. Drink up. Fine. Starve. What do I care?


Damon: Hello?
Alaric: Hey, it's Alaric Saltzman.
Damon: Before I hang up, how did you get this number?
Alaric: Ah, it's a mystery. Listen, I've, uh, been doing some digging on Elena's uncle. You interested?
Damon: What kind of digging?
Alaric: I've got an old friend from Duke. Who studied criminology when we were there together. Let's just say he's become a very proficient digger.
Damon: Well, did he find anything?
Alaric: Well, I had him run a track on John's cell records. He was getting a call from a number...The same number that Elena dialed to get Isobel. And then the number was disconnected.
Damon: Isobel knows John. Whatever. We knew that.
Alaric: Right. Well, after that, he started getting calls from a new number. And I had my friend run a geotrack. Got the address. It's...It's an apartment in Grove Hill.
Damon: Isobel's in Grove Hill?
Alaric: I don't know. I thought we could take a look and see what we find.
Damon: Perfect. Give me the address.
Alaric: Oh, so you can go without me? No. I don't think so.
Damon: I'm not going with you. You tried to kill me.
Alaric: Yeah, well, you did kill me.
Damon: Hold on.


Damon: What?
Elena: I'm just grabbing some clothes, and then I'll be right over. How's Stefan?
Damon: Extra broody. Hold on.  You drive. Pick me up in an hour.
Alaric: Done.


Damon: He won't eat anything.
Elena: He has to eat what's his favorite...Kind of, um...
Damon: His favorite kind of what?
Elena: Type of animal blood that he prefers?
Damon: Ew. Gross.
Elena: Heh. Your joking doesn't help.
Damon: Helps me. Now, hurry up. I can't baby-sit all night. I have things to do.
Elena: I would say, drop dead, but...
Damon: Ha ha. Stefan likes...Puppy blood...Little golden retriever puppies with cute, floppy ears. That's his favorite.
Gilbert Residence


John: Sorry.
Elena: Uncle John. I didn't see you there.
John: I thought we could talk. We haven't had a chance to catch up.
Elena: I'm actually just heading out, so...
John: Well, it won't take long.
Elena: What did you want to talk about?
John: Well...I know you know.
Elena: Know what?
John: It's really silly to keep pretending. What do you think your mother would say. If she knew you were dating a vampire?
Elena: Which mother?


Salvatore Boarding House


Quarry 1864


Stefan: I bet Johnathan Gilbert has told father by now. Wonder how he took the news that we're dead.
Damon: As if he cares. He betrayed us.
Stefan: He thought he was protecting us, Damon. He thought he was protecting this town.
Damon: God. This sun hurts my eyes.
Stefan: It's part of it. The muscle aches, the sick feeling...Emily says it's our bodies pushing us to feed, to complete the transition.
Damon: That's not gonna happen.
Stefan: Is that your choice, then? To die instead?
Damon: Isn't it yours? This was all to be with Katherine. But she's gone. I want it over.
Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: How you feelin'? Damon says you need to drink that. You need it, Stefan. Can't survive without it.
Stefan: I don't want to survive.
Elena: What? Don't say that.
Stefan: I'm sorry, Elena. No more. After what I've done, it has to end. I just want it over.


Damon: He's just being dramatic. He's not gonna starve himself.
Elena: Why would he say that?
Damon: He feels bad about hurting that girl. It's a very typical Stefan martyr stuff. It will pass.
Elena: Will it? Because he seemed to be in a lot of pain.
Damon: Yeah. Well, that will pass, too, once he eats.
Elena: I didn't mean physical pain.
Damon: I know what you meant. Look, are you gonna be okay here if I have to run out? I have to go to an errand with the teacher.
Elena: The teacher? Alaric? Are you two friends now?
Damon: I don't have any friends, Elena.
Elena: Right.
Damon: You should, um, you should stay up here. You shouldn't be down there by yourself.
Elena: I'll be fine.
Damon: You know...You're very trusting of him, given the circumstances.
Elena: So are you. Otherwise, you wouldn't be leaving.
Damon: I won't be long.
Mystic Grill


Pearl: Hello, Mr. Gilbert.
John: Pearl. What a pleasure. I must admit, I'm surprised that you came.
Pearl: Jenna tells me that you wanted to discuss the sale of the building in person.
John: Still, revealing yourself to me like this, it took quite a risk.
Pearl: I'm not stupid, Mr. Gilbert. You knew who I was when you requested the meeting. So, Damon tells me that you're looking for the device I took from Johnathan. I'm sure you realize I have no intention of giving it to you.
John: That's why I wanted to meet you. I'm planning on changing your mind.
Pearl: Really? How so?
John: With my Gilbert charm. I know that you have a weakness for it. May I buy you a drink?


Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: So, your mother was in love with Johnathan Gilbert, and he betrayed her?
Anna: Yup.
Jeremy: And now my uncle John wants this invention-device thing that she gave to Damon.
Anna: That's pretty much it.
Jeremy: John mentioned there were more Gilbert journals. I bet that's how he knows everything.
Anna: Do we have to talk about this all night? I've told you everything. I probably shouldn't have, 'cause that could get us both in a lot of trouble.
Jeremy: I'm not gonna say anything.
Anna: Your uncle John wants us dead.
Jeremy: Oh, you don't know that.
Anna: Yes, I do. He's a hater, Jeremy.
Jeremy: Well, I'm not.
Anna: No. You're something else entirely.
Jeremy: Oh, yeah? What would that be?
Anna: My weakness.


Jeremy: I don't want Jenna to walk in on us.
Anna: Jenna's in the kitchen. She just opened the refrigerator.
Jeremy: Wait. You can hear that? That is so cool.


Grove Hill Residence


Alaric: This is the one here. The records show is was paid 3 months in advance.
Damon: This is where it gets tricky. I may or may not be able to get in.
Alaric: Yeah, how does that work? You always have to be invited in?
Damon: By the owner or the person of entitlement. Short-term rentals and hotels are a bit of a gray area. You kind of gotta play it by ear.
Alaric: Heh. Could we not kill anyone tonight, please?
Damon: You mean, you just brought me along for my company?


Alaric: It doesn't look like anyone's home.
Damon: Yeah. I'm good. No permanent resident, apparently.


Damon: Uh, Ric, we have company.


Damon: Boys, boys, that's enough. I know you.
Henry: Damon?
Damon: Your name is Henry. You were in the tomb.
Henry: Yes, sir. What are you doing here?
Salvatore Estate 1864


Giuseppe: May I offer you a drink, Mr. Gilbert?
Johnathan: Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.
Giuseppe: This won't take much longer.
Johnathan: I want to make sure the founders' archives are accurate.
Giuseppe: Be sure you document the loss of civilian life in the church.
Johnathan: They were hardly civilians, Mr. Salvatore.
Giuseppe: As far as anyone needs to know, they were. As the record keeper for the Council, what you write will be passed down through generations. Certain details should be kept only between you and me.
Johnathan: For example?
Giuseppe: My sons. They will be remembered as the innocent victims of the Battle of Willow Creek, not for their shame.
Johnathan: Certainly, Mr. Salvatore.
Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: You know, Damon hasn't fed me vervain in a while. I could be at those bars in a flash, and you'd be dead.
Elena: Yeah, you could. But you won't.
Stefan: Please just go away. I don't want you here.


Stefan: What are you doing? Get out of here.
Elena: No.
Stefan: You're taking a stupid risk. I could hurt you.
Elena: Then I'm stupid. You need to drink this.
Stefan: Elena, get out of here, or you'll regret it.
Elena: Drink.
Stefan:  I said get out!


Elena: No.
Grove Hill Residence


Henry: So, how do you know John Gilbert?
Damon: Well, I've known him for years. He's a good friend. How do you know him?
Henry: I met him right after I got out of the tomb. He's been helping me out.
Alaric: Helping you out how?
Henry: Adapting. It's a whole new world...Cars, computers, match.com. There's so much to learn. He helped me get this place.
Alaric: So, do you live here alone or is there someone else here?
Damon: That's my friend's very passive-aggressive way of asking, uh, do you know a woman named Isobel?
Henry: Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel. I know John. He's my only real friend. He really showed me the ropes...how to use a microwave, separate my whites.
Alaric: What else do you do for him?
Henry: I help keep an eye on things...You know, with the others.
Damon: The others?
Henry: From the tomb. They're still pissed at the founding families for trying to burn them alive. I'm cool, but those tomb boys, they want revenge.
Alaric: What does John want with them?
Henry: He's just keeping an eye on them, you know? Trying to make sure they stay out of trouble.
Damon: Well, that's John. Heh. He's such a do-gooder.


Henry: Heh. That's John now.
Damon: Oh. Hey, let me talk to him.
Henry: All right. Yeah. Are you gonna answer that?
Damon: Am I gonna...answer that?


Henry: What's going on?


Damon: Let's not not kill anyone tonight. Your words. Just pointing that out.
Mystic Grill


John: My apologies.
Pearl: No apologies necessary. So, tell me, Mr. Gilbert, why should I let you have the device?
John: Because I can help you. I'm connected around here. The Town Council's eating out of my hand. They do whatever I say. And I know that you just want to live your life. Complete with a white picket fence, and I can help you do that.
Pearl: But the device doesn't work. Why would you even want it?
John: It's a family heirloom. Call me sentimental.
Pearl: Johnathan was ahead of his time.
John: I read his journals. They're very extensive. He actually wrote about you. You were his one regret. He loved you, and he hated himself for what he did to you.
Pearl: You're lying.
John: No. On his last days, he wrote how sorry he was. You were the only woman he ever loved.


John: Good God. You vampires...you're so emotional. Johnathan Gilbert hated you. His only regret was that he didn't drive a stake through your heart himself.
Pearl: I gave it to Damon.
John: What?
Pearl: I gave your device to Damon. Why don't you ask him for it yourself? I'm sure he'd be delighted to give it to you. And then, Mr. Gilbert, may you rot in hell.


Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Talk to me, Stefan. Why are you doing this?
Stefan: I'm making the decision I should have made years ago.
Elena: What are you talking about?
Stefan: You have to feed in order to complete the transition.
Elena: I know that.
Stefan: It was a choice I shouldn't have made.
Salvatore Estate 1864


Giuseppe: Dear God!
Stefan: Even in our death, you only feel shame?
Giuseppe: You're one of them now.
Stefan: No. Father, I came to say good-bye.
Giuseppe: I watched you die.
Stefan: You were there when we were shot?
Giuseppe: I pulled the trigger myself.
Stefan: You killed your own sons?
Giuseppe: You were both dead to me the moment you sided with the vampires. I only thank God that your mother isn't alive to see the disgrace you've become.
Stefan: I haven't turned yet. I don't want to. I'm going to let myself die, father. Please.
Giuseppe: Yes, you are.


Giuseppe: Uhh!
Stefan: Father, I didn't mean to.
Giuseppe: Get away from me.
Stefan: No, let me help you. Please.


Giuseppe: Ohh. Ohh.
Stefan: Uhh. Uhh! Oh, God. What's happening to me?


Salvatore Boarding House


Stefan: How can you even look at me right now?
Elena: You need to be able to talk about these things, Stefan. I need to hear them. Come upstairs. We can talk about it more, and we'll keep talking as long as you need.
Stefan: You're so sure I'm ready?


Elena: And when you feel the same way...I'll be upstairs.
Grove Hill Residence


Damon: Find anything yet?
Alaric: No, I looked everywhere. The place is...The place is clean.
Damon: Well, I found this. Behind the blood in the fridge.
Alaric: Oh, man, this was a real dead-end.
Damon: I wouldn't beat myself up over it, man. What did you think you were gonna find, huh? Isobel with a cigar and slippers?
Alaric: Oh, man. I...I gotta stop this. I can't...I can't keep searching for her.
Damon: Really? After only two years? That's actually moderately healthy.
Alaric: What are you going on? 146?
Damon: Well, I figure the 200 mark is probably a good stopping point.
Alaric: Ahh. I mean, no answer is enough. I keep thinking I wanna know why, when, you know, the precise moment. When my wife decided life with me wasn't enough.
Damon: She charmed me, your wife Isobel. She talked a good game, man. She was smart. She had this excitement in her eyes. I probably should have known there was something different about her, some tie to Katherine. There had to be some reason I didn't kill her.
Alaric: That's enough, Damon. I don't wanna hear anymore. I just don't want to waste any more of my life. Searching for answers that I really don't want. I'm through with Isobel. I...I'm done with all of this. Yeah.
Pearl's Residence


Anna: Hey. What's the matter?
Pearl: I need you to pack your things. We're leaving.
Anna: What? No.
Pearl: I was wrong to think that we could make a home here. It's time for us to move on.
Anna: But I don't want to move on. I want to stay.
Pearl: We can't stay. There's too many people here who know the truth...Too much history.
Anna: So, what, you're just gonna give up, pack us up, and move us out?
Pearl: It's not safe here. You know that.
Anna: Please.
Pearl: Is this is about Jeremy?
Anna: No. It's about me finally getting to build a life for myself. Please, mama.
Pearl: You gave me my life back. I am just trying to protect yours. I can't force you. It's your decision.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Ugh. God. You're still here?
Elena: Were you expecting anything else?
Damon: No. Ahh.


Elena: So, how was the errand?
Damon: Futile. Although, I think I witnessed the teacher having an existential crisis. Has Stefan eaten yet?
Elena: I thought you didn't care.
Damon: Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.
Elena: I think he's getting there. But he's got a lot of guilt that he has to deal with. And it doesn't help that you've spent the last 145 years punishing him for Katherine getting caught.
Damon: This is my fault now?
Elena: No, it's no one's fault, Damon. I'm just...saying you're not exactly innocent. You've made it your life's mission to make him miserable.


Damon: Let me ask you a question. In all this important soul-searching and cleansing of the demons of Stefan's past, did you ever manage to get the rest of the story?
Elena: He said there was more.
Damon: Yeah. That's an understatement.


Elena: Damon...Damon. Tell me.
Quarry 1864


Damon: What are you doing? Who is that?
Stefan: I brought her for you. She's a gift. Have a seat, please.
Damon: What have you done, Stefan?
Stefan: Damon, I've been to see father. He came at me. I didn't know my own strength. There was blood everywhere. He was dying, and the blood was too strong. I needed it. I had to have it.
Damon: You fed.
Stefan: Yes. And it's incredible. My body is exploding with power, Damon.
Damon: No.
Stefan: I can hear things from far away. I can see through the darkness. I can move, like it's magic. And the guilt, the pain...Damon, I can turn it off. Like a switch. Katherine was right. It's a whole another world out there, Damon.
Damon: Katherine is dead, Stefan. There's no world without her.
Stefan: No. You can turn that off, too. You don't have to feel that pain anymore.
Damon: I don't want it.
Stefan: You're weak. You'll be dead soon. You need this.
Damon: No.
Stefan: You'll die.
Damon: No. I can't.
Stefan: Please. I won't let you die.
Damon: No. I can't.
Stefan: Don't fight it. We can do this...together.


Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: From the moment Stefan had his first taste of human blood, he was a different person. I suppose I should thank him. It's been a hell of a ride. Heh.
Elena: Oh, my God. He said he wanted to die. That's why he won't feed. Now I understand why, but...
Damon: His choice. If he's stupid enough to make it, so be it.
Elena: Don't do that. Okay? Don't pretend like you don't care.
Damon: Where are you going?


Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: Hey.
Anna: It's getting impossible to sneak up on you.
Jeremy: Nice try, though.
Anna: Sorry I woke you.
Jeremy: That's okay. You only woke me halfway.
Anna: So, listen. I...
Jeremy: That feels good.


Anna: Good-bye.
Quarry


Quarry 1864


Stefan: How do you feel?
Damon: You were right. It is a whole new world.
Stefan: We can explore it together.
Damon: You got what you wanted...You and me for all eternity. But here this, brother. I will make it an eternity of misery for you.
Stefan: Damon!


Emily: You've transitioned.
Stefan: You'd have rather found me dead?
Emily: Katherine saved my life once. I owed her. That doesn't mean I'd wish her curse on anyone.
Stefan: It feels more like a gift.
Emily: That will change.
Stefan: Why is that?
Emily: Because even in death, your heart is pure, Stefan. I sense that about you. That will be your curse.
Stefan: Emily, wait.
Quarry


Elena: Stefan. Damon told me the rest of the story. I thought I might find you here.
Stefan: I should have died that night, just like I had chosen. I should have let Damon die, too.
Elena: But you didn't. And if you die now, it's not gonna change what happened.
Stefan: Every single person that's been hurt...Every single life that's been lost, it's because of me.
Elena: The night that my parents died...I blew off family night so that I could go to some party. I ended up getting stranded, and they had to come pick me up. That's why we ended up in the car at Wickery Bridge. And that's why they died. Our actions are what set things in motion. But we have to live with that.
Stefan: I made a choice, Elena. Because of that choice, a lot of people were hurt.
Elena: You also made a choice to stop, to reject the person that the blood made you. You made a choice to be good, Stefan.
Stefan: No. Please don't do that.
Elena: That's the person who jumped in the water to save the family whose car had driven off the bridge.
Stefan: Please. Don't make this all okay.
Elena: That's the person who saved my life.
Stefan: You don't understand, Elena.
Elena: Then tell me.
Stefan: It hurts me. It hurts me, knowing what I've done, and that pain...That pain is with me all the time. And every day, I think that if I just...If I just give myself over to the blood, I can make that pain stop. It would be that easy, and every day, I fight that. And I am so terrified that one day, I'm not gonna want to fight that anymore, Elena. And the next time I hurt somebody...It could be you.
Elena: There will be no next time.
Stefan: You don't know that.
Elena: Maybe I don't. But what I do know. Is that you can take this, throw it in the quarry, and let the sun rise. Or you could take this ring and put it on and keep fighting.


Elena: It's your choice.


Stefan: Elena.


Pearl's Residence


Pearl: Thank you, Harper.
Harper: You're welcome.
Pearl: Annabelle should be back in a minute. You know, you don't have to come with us if you don't want to.
Harper: This was never my home, Miss Pearl. I was just a soldier who was left to die. You saved me. I'm coming with you.
Pearl: Let me help you with these.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Little boy lost.
Elena: I'll be upstairs, OK?
Stefan: Okay.
Elena: Good night, Damon.


Stefan: Thank you.
Damon: No, Stefan, thank you. You're back on Bambi blood, and I'm the big badass brother again. All is right in the world.
Stefan: I mean it. Thank you. For...helping her take care of me.
Damon: You brood too much. Everything on this planet is not your fault. My actions, what I do, it's not your fault. I own them. They belong to me. You are not allowed to feel my guilt.
Stefan: Do you feel guilt?
Damon: If I wanted to, it's there. Emily waited till after I turned to tell me she'd been successful in protecting Katherine with her spell. She didn't want me to know about the tomb. She thought it would impact my decision.
Stefan: She didn't want either one of us to turn. She said it was a curse.
Damon: Witches...Judgy little thing.
Stefan: Why didn't you tell me?
Damon: 'Cause I didn't want you to know. 'Cause I hated you and I still do.
Stefan: I know.
Damon: But not because you forced me to turn.
Stefan: Then why?
Damon: Because she turned you. It was just supposed to be me, Stefan...Just me.

Anna: I'm back. Oh! Mom! Mama! Uhh! Please don't leave me again. No. Please wake up. You have to wake up. No.

John: Sheriff Forbes, it's John Gilbert. Sorry to call so late. I have an update about the vampires.

Isobel: Hello, Ric.


Alaric: Isobel.

Mystic Grill


Isobel: It's good to see you. You look good. I hear that you're a high school history teacher? How is that?
Alaric: Where have you been, Isobel?
Isobel: I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you. I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you. I wanted this.
Alaric: It's that simple?
Isobel: Yeah. You were supposed to mourn me, and move on.
Alaric: You were my wife, and I loved you. How could I not search for you?
Isobel: Because I wasn't lost, Rick.


Isobel: I understand that you know my daughter Elena and I hear that she's been looking for me. So...


Isobel: I want you to arrange for a meeting with us.


Alaric: You want me to deliver a message?
Isobel : Yeah.


Alaric: Screw you. You selfish bitch.




Alaric: What do you want from me?
Isobel: I told you.
Alaric: I'm not gonna do anything for you.


Isobel: You better tell Elena that I want to meet or I'm gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one and I'm gonna start with your history students. Got it?


Gilbert Residence


Elena: I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic float for the Founders' Day parade. If I don't I get the wrath of Caroline but I wanted to check in first.
Damon: Well, I'm doing great, thanks for asking.
Elena: Checking on Stefan.
Damon: Oh, him? Oh, he's...he's terrible.
Elena: What's the matter?
Damon: He's just back to boring, straight-laced, off the junk. You've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality.
Elena: Don't forget who helped me.
Damon: I hate myself.  Did Uncle John mention anything to you about my field trip with the history teacher?
Elena: No. I'm still been avoiding him. Why? What's he up to?
Damon: I don't know. But I'd love if you could find out for me.
Elena: I've got to go I'm late.
Damon: Have fun with the Mystic queen, I know I did.


Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Elena called.


Mystic Falls High School


Alaric: So these are the specs for the History department. For the Founders' Day float we'll be recreating the battle of Willow Creek. Tyler has been nominated at the head of the production design.
Tyler: By whom?
Alaric: By me. I've seen your sketches and they're good.
Tyler: I'm not really into the...
Alaric: Well, you just pick your team, be creative and... Don't screw up.


Tyler: Great! : You want to help me out with this?
Matt: Not really, no.
Elena: Hey Mr. Saltzman.
Alaric: Come with me. We need to talk.


Bonnie: Alright, show me.
Caroline: Let's reference last years Miss Mystic float.


Caroline: This is what they did last year  and this is exactly what we don't want to do.
Bonnie: Ew. Okay! So, what are we doing?
Caroline: Southern classic elegance.
Bonnie: Gone with the Wind?
Caroline: How'd you know?
Bonnie: You channel Scarlett, daily.
Caroline: So true!


Caroline: Where's Elena? She's supposed to be helping.
Bonnie: I don't know.
Caroline: Okay, what's the deal?
Bonnie: What do you mean?
Caroline: Don't play dumb. You and Elena are fighting. Spill!
Bonnie: It's nothing.
Caroline: It's not nothing. You know this whole float is supposed to be about friends creating something together and everyone is fighting. Matt and Tyler hate each other, you and Elena are on the outs and I don't like it! And I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong.
Bonnie: I can't talk about it, Caroline, I'm sorry.




Alaric: Damon, thanks for coming.
Damon: Sorry I'm late. My dog ate my uh...never mind.


Damon: What's with all the furrowed brows?
Alaric: I saw Isobel last night.
Damon: Isobel is here?  In town?


Isobel's Residence


Isobel: You're late.
John: I didn't realize there was a schedule. What's with the side show?
Isobel: Cherie is a little jazz singer that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn. And I got the cowboy at a gay rodeo in Amarillo.
John: He's gay?
Isobel: Not right now, he's very good to me.  Hey Cherie? Cassez vous!


Isobel: I'm teaching them French. Oh! I can smell the judgment coming off of you.
John: Well, they're people, Isobel, and you're treating them like dolls.
Isobel: If we're gonna be partners you really have to stop being such a hater.
John: We're in a partnership together because we share a mutual goal. Don't ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle.
Isobel: My lifestyle? So, I assume that you still don't have the invention.
John: I'll get it. I said I would.
Isobel: Uh, you threatened to expose Damon Salvatore, that didn't work. You killed that Pearl lady, still no invention. I really don't think that your plan is working, John.
John: Well, you being here is not going to help anything.


Isobel: You failed, John. I'm gonna take it from here.


Mystic Falls High School


Damon: Did you ask her about Uncle John? Are they working together?
Alaric: No.
Damon: No they're not?
Alaric: No, I didn't ask.
Damon: What about the invention?
Alaric: Didn't ask.
Damon: Did she know about the tomb vampires?
Alaric: I don't know.
Damon: Did words completely escape you?
Alaric: No, I was a little too distracted by my dead vampire wife to ask any questions.


Damon: What did she want?
Elena: She wants to see me, Damon.


Stefan: Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting. We don't know why or what she wants.
Damon : You don't have to see her if you don't want to.


Elena: I don't really have a choice.
Alaric: She's threatened to go on killing spree.
Damon: Oh! I take it that's not okay with you guys.
Elena: I want to do it. I want to meet her. If I don't, I know I'll regret it.


Mystic Grill


Elena: Can you hear me? Thanks for coming, I'm nervous.


Elena: I'm happy that you're here. I love you.


Isobel: Hello Elena. You look just like her, that's eerie.
Elena: You've met Katherine?
Isobel: She found me after I turned. Genetic curiosity, I suppose. She would be fascinated by you.


Elena: Is that how you can walk in the day?
Isobel: Katherine helped me obtain it.
Elena: Who's my father?
Isobel: Not important. He was a teenage waste of space.
Elena: A name would be nice.
Isobel: It would, wouldn't it? You ask a lot of questions.
Elena: Why did you compel that man to kill himself? Right after he told me to stop looking for you.
Isobel: Dramatic impact. I wish it would have been more effective.
Elena: Human life means that little to you?
Isobel: Means nothing to me. It's just part of being what I am.
Elena: No it's not. I know other vampires, that's not true.
Isobel: Your new boyfriend over there by the pool table? Stefan Salvatore. Why Stefan? Why didn't you go for Damon? Or are you enjoying them both like Katherine did?




Damon: We should be in there.
Alaric: No, Isobel made it clear we're not to step a foot inside.
Damon: I'm not going to kill her in a crowded restaurant.
Alaric: You're not going to kill her period!
Damon: She ruined your life and you still want to protect her?
Alaric: She's my wife.  Was my wife. I looked for the woman I married but she wasn't there. Whoever that is, she's cold and detached.
Damon: Yeah, she's given up her humanity.
Alaric: Yeah, see, I don't get that. Stefan has his humanity, he's a good guy. And you're a dick and you kill people but I still see something human in you. But with her there was...nothing.
Damon: You can turn it off, like a button you can press. I mean, Stefan's different. He wants the whole human experience. He wants to feel every episode of How I Met Your Mother, so he shuts his feelings out. The problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel. Isobel chose the easier road - no guilt, no shame, no regret. I mean, come on, if you could turn it off, wouldn't you?
Alaric: You haven't.
Damon: Of course I have, Rick. It's why I'm so fun to be around.


Elena: Why did you want to meet me? Can't be to just catch up.
Isobel: Because I'm curious about you. But the real reason is: I want what your uncle wants. Johnathan Gilbert's invention.
Elena: How do you know my uncle?
Isobel: I used to spend a lot of time here when I was younger. John had a crush on me for years. He was the first one that told me about vampires.
Elena: So what made you want to be one?
Isobel: It's a very long list of reasons, Elena. All of which I'm sure you've thought about.
Elena: No.
Isobel: That was your first lie. It's inevitable, you're going to get old, Stefan won't. . Forever doesn't last very long when you're human.
Elena: I'm sorry but I don't have what you're looking for.


Isobel: Sit down  and tell your boyfriend to walk away. I want the invention.
Elena: I don't have it.
Isobel: I know that but Damon does and you're going get it for me.
Elena: He's not going to give it to me.
Isobel: Then the blood will be on your hands.


Isobel: It was nice meeting you Elena.


Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: Hey Anna. Where are you? What's up? Uh...Give me a call when you get this.


Jenna: How is Anna? I like that girl, she has fire.
Jeremy: I don't know. She won't return my calls.


John: Girl trouble?
Jeremy: No, no trouble. Anna just owes me a call, that's it.
John: Is that the girl that I show you with at the Founders' pageant? You two are getting hot and heavy. When was the last time you saw her?
Jeremy: Why?
John: I was just making conversation. No one else in this house likes me. At least I can talk to you especially if you need someone to talk to about girls.
Jenna: Oh please! I'm eating.


John: So seriously, how well do you know Anna?
Jeremy: I know Anna extremely well.
John: I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything. I'm here to answer any questions that you have, to help you in any way I can.
Jeremy: Why?
John: Because your dad would want me to.
Jeremy: I'm ah...I'm good.


Isobel's Residence


Damon: Oh Oh Cherie, you won again. I hope I'm wearing my good underwear.


Isobel: And it's just one blast from the past after another. No, no, no.


Isobel: Degage, Cherie.


Damon: It's good to see you, Isobel. I was just having fun with your naughty little minion.
Isobel: How did you find me?


Damon: Searched all the neighborhood bank-owned foreclosures and found the most expensive one.
Isobel: Oh I should have known. You're the one who taught me that. What are you really doing here?
Damon: Well you caused quite a stir, you blew into town. Saw everyone except for the man who made you. I'm a little hurt. 
Isobel: I'm so sorry. 
Damon: Heh. Ow. What are you doing with John Gilbert?
Isobel: We dated a few times when we were young. He was a little bit in love with me.
Damon: I'm sure. One of the many. Now, this little invention what do you want with it?
Isobel: Oh, me personally? I don't want anything with it. I'm just doing what I'm told. You know Damon we're on the same side.


Damon: Oh yeah? What side is that?
Isobel: Katherine's. She wants John Gilbert to have the device and I think that you know that she's not happy when she doesn't get what she wants.


Damon: Why are you doing her dirty work?
Isobel: Don't kill the messenger. We both know that you can't control Katherine. She does what she wants.
Damon: So do I.
Isobel: Oh really Damon? You do? 


Damon: Now that I have your attention, listen up. You do not come into my town; threaten the people I care about. Going after Elena? Bad move. You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits because I do believe in killing the messenger. You know why? Because it sends a message.  Katherine wants something from me? You tell that little bitch to come get it herself.
Gilbert Residence


Elena: Hi.
Bonnie: Hey. I couldn't sleep last night. You were obviously upset about something and I just walked away. It's not me. That can't be us. You're my friend, Elena. If you need me I'm here for you and I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
Elena: I met my birth mother.
Bonnie: Oh. Was it...Are you okay?


Mystic Falls High School


Tyler: Hey man. So Caroline tells me you've been on your own for the past two weeks. Is everything okay?
Matt: You're asking me about my mom. Seriously? Look, man, why don't I just give tell her to give you a call when she comes back to town?
Tyler: Dude, that's not what I meant okay? I'm just trying to...I don't know what to say.
Matt: Good men, don't say anything. You're a dick, end of the story.
Tyler: I know.  Yeah, whatever.


Bonnie: Hey! Thanks for meeting me. I wanted you to see this.
Elena: Is that Emily's spell book?
Bonnie: I've been going through it since Grams died. Check this out.


Elena: That's the vampire compass.
Bonnie: Yeah, according to Emily, Johnathan Gilbert never actually succeeded in inventing anything. Emily secretly spelled them all with magic. Compass, rings and the mystery device you told me about.


Elena: Yeah that's it. Well, a part of it. Damon only has the one piece.
Bonnie: Emily pledged her loyalty to Katherine. But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed. This was the only way she could think of to help. To let Johnathan Gilbert believe that he'd actually invented these devices.
Elena: Does it say what it does?


Bonnie: Are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
Elena: Yeah, I'm sure. Why?
Bonnie: This is a weapon. Against vampires.




Jeremy: Elena!
Elena: Hey, have you seen Stefan? I need to find him.
Jeremy: No, not lately. Listen, do you have a second?
Elena: Yeah. What's up? What's going on?
Jeremy: Well, it's Anna. I've left her all this messages and she hasn't gotten back to me, not even a text.
Elena: Anna? I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
Jeremy: We're more than friends. Look, something could be seriously wrong and if you know anything you've got to tell me.
Elena: I haven't talked to her, Jer.
Jeremy: Are you lying to me right now?
Elena: Why do you say that?
Jeremy: Cause that's what you do. Lying. You lie about everything. I know what Anna is and I know that you know. So tell me, do you have any idea where she is?
Elena: No, but Jer...Jeremy wait! Jeremy!


Elena: Isobel. What are you doing here?
Isobel: I'm your mother, Elena. I want to be more involved in your life.
Elena: I don't want you in my life.
Isobel: I understand that. You already have a lot of people that you care about but I've been studying. Let's see if I got this right.


Isobel: There is the witchy best friend, Bonnie. Gonna stay away from that one.


Isobel: Oh...sad little brother Jeremy.


Isobel: And there's Caroline...obnoxious Caroline. I got all of my info from her by the way. She had no idea who I was and she wouldn't stop yapping. Oh...


Isobel: And there's Matt, friend, ex, yappy's future ex. Lots of connections there.
Elena: Matt is not involved in this.
Isobel: He's involved with you, isn't he?
Elena: Look, you shouldn't be here. You need to leave.
Isobel: No, I have some friends here too. Look, you see that man over here, standing next to Matt by the Float? His name is Frank, he's very handsome and he's also quite handy and he'd noticed that the axles are a little rusty which is very dangerous. So, all you have to do is apply a little bit of pressure and...
Elena: No!


Matt: Get this trailer! Come on guys help me!


Stefan: Caroline, call an ambulance.
Elena: Why are you doing this?
Isobel: I'm showing you how easy it is to hurt the people that you care about.
Elena: And you're doing this just because of Johnathan Gilbert's invention?
Isobel: Hand it over and all will be stop.
Elena: I told you, Damon is not going to give it to me.
Isobel: I think that you underestimate how much Damon cares about you.
Elena: He'll kill you before he gives it up.
Isobel: Is that before or after I kill your brother Jeremy?


Elena: Jeremy?


Elena: Jeremy?!


Caroline: The ambulance is saying in 15-20 minutes.
Tyler: I have my car. I can take him to the hospital.
Matt: Caroline can take me.
Caroline: I didn't drive.
Matt: I'll wait. Its fine.
Caroline: You will not wait okay?! You need to see a doctor, Tyler is driving. End of story.
Matt: Fine!
Caroline: Go!
Tyler: I'll bring my car around.


Isobel's Residence


John: I see you're packing. That's a good sign.
Isobel: It won't be long now.
John: Did you get the missing piece? Where is it?
Isobel: I don't have it yet.
John: Then, why did you call me here?


Isobel: Because I have the next best thing.


John: What the hell are you doing?
Isobel: Getting what I want.
John: Yeah but he is my nephew and you're going let him go right this second!
Isobel: That gaudy ring on your finger comes off.
John: Come on Isobel, I know you okay? It's me John. You can't hurt a kid.
Isobel: I'll kill him to prove you wrong.
John: Really? Are you that far gone? Look, I know you've changed but the old Isobel is somewhere in there, isn't she? Come on let him go.
Isobel : Faites le souffrir.


Isobel: Nice try. We'll see how you do without this.


Mystic Falls High School


Bonnie: Where is the device?
Stefan: Damon has it. He's going to be difficult to reason with.
Elena: We'll go to him, I'll talk to him.
Stefan: He's not just gonna hand it over, especially if it's harmful to vampires.
Elena: What if it's not?


Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: Absolutely not!
Elena: Just hear me out.
Damon: I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she could give it to John who is going to turn it to kill me. I like being a living dead person.
Elena: But it'll be useless, Bonnie can take its power away.
Damon: I don't trust her.
Bonnie: I can remove the original spell.
Elena: John and Isobel will never know.
Damon: No, I'll get Jeremy in my own way.
Stefan: Really? How are you going to do that? Because Isobel is a vampire and Jeremy could be dead the second you walk in the door.
Damon : Are you even up for this? I mean no offense, you're no Emily Bennett. Emily knew what she was doing.
Bonnie: I've been practicing.
Damon: It's not piano lessons, honey.
Bonnie: What's your favorite book?
Damon: What?
Bonnie: Name a book, any book.
Damon: Name a book...How about Call of the wild, Jack London?


Damon: Jack London. Great parlor trick.
Elena: We're doing this, Damon. And we're doing it my way. Now give me the device. We're wasting time!
Damon : I don't trust you, I tried to kill you.
Bonnie: You're right, you can't trust me.
Elena: But you can trust me.


Elena: Thank you.
Isobel's Residence


Jeremy: Here you go .
John: Thank you.
Jeremy: What is she after?
John: Your ancestor invented a weapon, a device that's extremely harmful to vampires and we've been trying to get it.
Jeremy: Why?
John: Because there's a group of vampires from a long time ago that wants revenge on this town.
Jeremy: But why would a vampire help you kill other vampires?
John: She has her own reasons for wanting them dead. Look Jeremy, no one ever thought vampires would return to this town. Not in modern times, but they have and we have to destroy them.
Jeremy: All of them? No, there are some good ones out there.
John: There's no such things.
Jeremy: I don't believe that.
John: Well, your dad did. And has his son that should mean something to you.
Jeremy: How did my father know about all this?
John: Who do you think told me about the family history?
Salvatore Boarding House


Bonnie: Done.


Damon: Great, now what?
Elena: Now we give it to Isobel.
Mystic Falls


Isobel: Where is the device?
Elena: Where is my brother?
Isobel: This isn't a negotiation. Where is the invention?
Elena: Where is my brother?
Isobel: Do you really think that I came alone?


Elena: Did you really think that I came alone?


Isobel: For god sakes, call home.
Elena: What?
Isobel: Call home and ask to speak to your brother Jeremy.


Jeremy: Hello?
Elena: Jeremy, are you okay?
Jeremy: Yeah yeah I'm fine, Uncle John hit his head. It was an accident.
Jenna: We're all laughing.
Jeremy: But yeah I'm okay.
Elena: I'll be home soon, alright?
Jeremy: Yeah.


Elena: You were never gonna hurt him.
Isobel: No, I was going to kill him. Don't look for any redeeming qualities in me. I don't have any.
Elena: But you took a risk with Damon. How did you know that he was gonna give it to me?
Isobel: Because he's in love with you.


Elena : Thank you.
Isobel: For what?
Elena: For being such a monumental disappointment. It keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact.
Isobel: Goodbye, Elena. As long as you have a Salvatore on each arm, you're doomed. Katherine was smart. She got out. But we all know that you're not Katherine.


Gilbert Residence


Elena: Jeremy we have to talk about all this.
Jeremy: No, we really don't.
Elena: I don't know what Anna told you but there are things that you need to know.
Jeremy: Yeah? Because I'm pretty sure that your journal covered it.
Elena: You read my journal?
Jeremy: And save me the speech about invasion of privacy because I read a section about Damon erasing my memory, about what happened to Vicki.
Elena: Jeremy, please, you don't understand. The night that Vicki died, it was like mom and dad died all over again. It was all over your face and it hurt so much to see you like that. I just wanted to take away your pain. I'm so sorry.
Jeremy: Get out!
Elena: No, Jeremy!
Jeremy: Elena! Just get out. Please.


Elena: Jer, I....


Mystic Falls High School


Alaric: What do you want?
Isobel: I totally get it, you, here as a history teacher. It's good.
Alaric: What the hell are you doing? You act like you don't care and yet here you are hunting me down.
Isobel: I'm leaving. I just thought I said goodbye.
Alaric: You couldn't be bothered the first time so why now?
Isobel: You hate me. Good.
Alaric: Does that make it easier for you? I mean what is the whole point of this exercise?
Isobel: What did you expect? You spent all this time trying to track me down. What did you think you would find?
Alaric: The woman who gave me this . I mean you act like you don't care but you care enough to protect me after you left.
Isobel: I was a different person back then.
Alaric: Right! And that person is gone. The woman that I married, the woman I loved, she's just...she's gone.


Alaric: You expect me to believe that?


Isobel: What are you doing?
Alaric: Well, I'm ring free, I'm vervain free. So, either kill me or compel me because I don't believe it. Not for a second.


Isobel: I wanted this-I needed this-and I'm going to regret it forever. This was my mistake, not yours.


Isobel: You're not going to remember this. I loved you, I did and when I think about what I gave up it hurts. But now your heart is free of me, it's easier this way. Goodbye Ric.


Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: Anna? What are you doing here?
Anna : My mother. She's dead.
Jeremy: What?
Anna: She was killed.
Jeremy: Oh, my god, Anna. Hey, I'm so sorry.
Anna: I know I'm not supposed to be here but I don't have anywhere else to go.


Jeremy: It's okay.
Salvatore Boarding House


Damon: Would you like one? Say it, whatever it is, purge, get it out.
Stefan: It's about what Isobel said.
Damon: What about?
Stefan: Well, I know that you and Elena have bounded and I know that she cares about you and...I know you care about her.
Damon: Well, this is going in an interesting direction.
Stefan: I'm just concerned about Elena being hurt. She considers you a friend.
Damon: Same here, Elena is a very good friend. Actually, she might qualify as my only...friend. Is that a problem?
Stefan: So, at the risk of sounding like uh...like a jealous boyfriend.
Damon: Oh, there's no risk, you do.
Stefan: History will not be repeating itself where Elena is concerned. Do you understand what I'm saying?
Damon: Sure. Sure.


Stefan: Do you understand?
Damon: Whatever you say man, I mean honestly we're just friends and as a friend I wasn't looking forward to telling her the truth anyway so, I'll let you do it.
Stefan: What truth?
Damon: About John. Because I know you guys don't like to keep secrets from each other.
Stefan: What are you talking about?
Damon: Am I the only one around here who has the ability to put two and two together? Isobel! Hello? She dated John when she was 15; she gets pregnant and ends up at the doctor's office of John's brother. Now, what do you think John's role is in all this? I mean, go ahead, and think about it, I'll wait. Did you get it? You there yet?
Stefan: So you think that John is Elena's father?
Damon: Ding, ding, ding, ding!
Stefan: What proof do you have?
Damon: I don't need any proof, that's a DNA test for John, Elena and Maury Povich to deal with but I know how well you deal with these bombs so...Sleep tight.


Damon: Oh and when you do tell Elena and she needs a friend to talk to about anything, I'm here for her.


Gilbert Residence


John: Hello?
Isobel: On your doorstep you'll find what you've been looking for.
John: And my ring?
Isobel: Don't screw this up. You know what you have to do, John.


John: I got it. I won't fail.


Isobel: You better not. Katherine wants all of those tomb vampires dead, and I want to add two more to that list.


John: Let me guess.
Isobel: Stefan and Damon. I don't want this life for her.
John: That was always part of the plan. Consider them gone.
Isobel: She's our daughter, John. We owe that to her.
John: I know.


Mystic Grill
Caroline: So you're not going to tell me what happened?
Bonnie: I did something bad, Caroline, and I lied about it.
Caroline: To who?
Bonnie: To Elena. I pretended to do something I didn't really do.
Caroline: What are you talking about?
Bonnie: I couldn't do what she wanted me to do. It wasn't right. Grams would have never done it, so I couldn't either. But when Elena finds out, she's never gonna forgive me.

Gilbert Residence and Salvatore Boarding House


Elena: Ouch, this dress hurts.
Jenna: Suck it in, baby.

Mystic Falls High School


Mrs Lockwood: No, no, no, no, no! It's all wrong! The marching band should be in front of the Historic Society. Matt, get up on the float. Boys, I asked you to put chairs on the Founders' Float. Ladies! Time to get on the float.


Damon: Look at you, all retro.
Stefan: What are you doing here?
Damon: Why wouldn't I be here? Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention, Isobel is gone and it's Founders' Day! I'm here to eat cotton candy and steal your girl.
Stefan: Don't start with me, Damon.
Damon: Oh, you started this Stefan with that whole I'm insecure, leave Elena alone speech. I'm enjoying that.
Stefan: As long as you heard it.
Damon: What? You have no sense of humor, Stefan.
Stefan: Actually I've no sense of 'Damon humor'.
Damon: 'Damon humor'...Hey look, I get it, I get it. I'm the better, hotter, superior choice and you're scared, now that Katherine is out of the picture, that I'm gonna turn all my attention to Elena. But don't worry, Elena is not Katherine.
Stefan: You're right, she's not.


Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: Anna.
Anna: Look at you!
Jeremy: I know, it's stupid, huh? I'm part of the parade; but how are you? I've been so worried and I feel awful.
Anna: Why? You didn't kill my mother, your uncle did.
Jeremy: Are you sure it was him?
Anna: Who else would have done it?
John: He doesn't understand, Anna, it's who he is. He hates all vampires. He's just doing what he thinks is right.
Anna: Are you defending him?
Jeremy: No, no way. It's just...I do understand where he's coming from. He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just...he's trying to protect it.
Anna: They do want revenge, or at least they did, but that's why we separated from them. My mom wasn't after revenge; she just wanted her life back. I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.
Jeremy: You're leaving?
Anna: I've been thinking...you could come with me. I could turn you. I mean...you said you wanted me to. Here.


Anna: It's my blood. If you die with it in your system, you'll come back.
Jeremy: Anna...
Anna: I know you, what it's like for you...being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand. But when you're a vampire, you don't have to feel that way. You can shut it off. I can show you how.
Jeremy: I wanted to, I did.


Jeremy: But I don't think I can. Sorry.


Mystic Falls High School


Elena: John?! Is that even possible?
Stefan: There is no proof, but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager and he was the one who brought her to your dad's office for the delivery.
Elena: My whole life I've never liked this man. I...
Stefan: Sorry, I'm sorry. I just...I wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it on you on some typically inappropriate way.
Elena: No, I'm happy that you told me, I just...I really hope that it's not true. What I am supposed to do? Do I just...confront him and say are you my biological father?
Stefan: I guess, when you're ready.
Elena: I'm never gonna be ready. Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about. Jeremy hates me, and why wouldn't he? My journal gave him every single reason to.
Stefan: He's just hurt, he's confused.
Elena: He's never going to forgive me for Vicki, for taking away his memories, for lying to him.
Stefan: He's your brother, he'll forgive you. Just give him some time.


Bonnie: Say cheese!
Caroline : Oh wait! Hide your cast, it's not era-appropriate!
Matt: Seriously?
Caroline: Yes!
Matt: Okay, fine.


Caroline: I want one with Bonnie now.
Tyler: Here, I can take it.


Matt: I'll be on the float.


Tyler: I said I was sorry!
Caroline: You made out with his mother and then you beat him to a pulp. You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry.




Elena: Jeremy! I was wondering where you were. You look great, and you guys did a really great job on the float.
Jeremy: Go away, Elena.
Elena: Jeremy, come on! Please! I don't want it to be like this between us.
Jeremy: Why don't you have Damon erase my memory again? Then I could go back to being your in-the-dark little brother.
Elena: Jer, please.
Jeremy: Just don't! You can't fix this that easily; something like this doesn't just get fixed.




Mrs Lockwood: Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Fall's high school Marching Band!


Mrs Lockwood: And for a little local history, Mr. Saltzman's students have recreated Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek.


Mrs Lockwood: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our stunning Miss Mystic Falls Court and their handsome escorts.


Mrs Lockwood: This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls. Aren't they beautiful?


Bonnie: What do you want?
Damon: Just watching the parade.


Damon: Where are you going?
Bonnie: Away from you.
Damon: I wanna say something to you.
Bonnie: Just leave me alone!
Damon: Thank you. The device that Emily spelled could have killed me. I don't take what you did lightly so...thank you.
Bonnie: I did it for Elena.
Damon: I know that, but I'm still very grateful. And...I owe you.


Damon: Enjoy the parade.


Mrs Lockwood: Let's cheer for the Mystic Fall's high school football team. Alright! Let's show them our support, everybody!


Grayson Gilbert's Office


John: This is the key. Once inserted, the device will be activated. It will work only once, for an estimated time of 5 minutes.
Mayor Lockwood: Yes, how does it work?
John: It's a high-pitched frequency that humans can't hear. Any vampires within a five-block radius will be incapacitated, exposing them. At that time, the sheriff's deputies will inject them with vervain and bring them here, when we will finish them off.
Mayor Lockwood: And you're certain they're attacking tonight?
John: I have a source. One of the vampires from the tomb confirmed the attack.

Vampire leader: Everybody listen up! The plan stays the same. We wait until the firework start; until then, we blend in. Stay a part of the celebration; they'll never see us coming.
Grayson Gilbert's Office
John: They want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864. It makes us their target.

Vampire leader: This area here is the stage. This is where the Founding Families are gonna be. Any questions?
Grayson Gilbert's Office
Mayor Lockwood: We're taking an enormous risk. We're talking about our families, John!

Vampire leader: Anna? What are you doing here?
Grayson Gilbert's Office
John: This is the only way to draw them out and kill them...all of them.
Mystic Grill


Damon: I like you better like this. The period look, it...didn't suit you.
Elena: Is that an insult?
Damon: Actually Elena, it is a compliment of the highest order.
Elena: Look, I know Stefan is worried about our...friendship.
Damon: Did he mention something to you too?
Elena: No, did he mention something to you?
Damon: No, nothing worth repeating.
Elena: So, I think you should stop with the flirty little comments and that eye-thing that you do.
Damon : What eye thing?
Elena: Don't make me regret being your friend okay?


Elena: I don't believe that we can't fix this. I lied, I was wrong. But you're my brother, Jer, and I love you, and I have to fix it. So just tell me, what can I do?
Jeremy: You go to hell, Elena.


Town Square


Damon : I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them. Being a teenager is so hard!
Jeremy: You're a dick!
Damon: You do not talk to me like that! I'm not your sister. And for now on,  don't talk to your sister that way either.
Jeremy: So, you're going to kill me just cause I hurt Elena's feelings?
Damon: Cut her some slack.
Jeremy: She erased my memories.
Damon: No, I did! She was protecting you.
Jeremy: It wasn't her call to make.


Jeremy: Let go of me before I cause a scene.
Damon: You'll be unconscious before you even got a word out.


Stefan: Let him go.


Stefan: Are you alright?
Jeremy: Yeah.
Stefan : What my brother is trying to say is, don't blame Elena for this. Damon turned Vicki, I killed her. She was a threat to you, and she was a threat to your sister. I'm sorry that it happened, I wish that it hadn't.


Jeremy: You shouldn't have made me forget...


Damon: Good cop, bad cop. I like it.
Stefan: What are you doing?
Damon: He's being a punk.
Stefan: Elena's relationship with her brother is none of your business. So stay out of it!
Damon: Oh, there's only one do-gooder role available. My bad. I'm sorry.


Stefan: Get over yourself. We both know you're not doing this for the right reasons.
Damon: You see, there you go with that little jealousy act again. What are the right reasons, Stefan? Enlighten me, please!
Stefan: Well, see Damon, it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing for nothing in return, and I know that it is an entirely foreign concept to you. I completely understand that you wouldn't get it.

Sheriff Forbes: You want to use our town as bait? It's too dangerous, it's insane!


Mayor Lockwood: We've gone over the plans with all your deputies, they're all on board.
Sheriff Forbes: You've gone behind my back?
Mayor Lockwood: Yeah, because we knew this is exactly how you'd react.
Sheriff Forbes: Our children are here.
John: Liz, we need to do this. We have no choice; this is the reason for the Secret Council. Our founding fathers created the Secret Council for just this purpose!


Sheriff Forbes: I'm the Sheriff, it's my call and I say no.
John: Richard, let me speak to the Sheriff alone.


Sheriff Forbes: John, you're not thinking clearly, I'm not gonna change my mind about this.


Mystic Falls


Damon: You're still around?
Anna: There's something you need to know. The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight.
Damon: How do you know this?
Anna: I went to them. They think I'm with them but I'm not. They want the Founding Families dead.
Damon: When is this supposed to happen?
Anna: When the firework start.


Damon: John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them.
Anna: Then we can't be here!
Damon: It doesn't work, it's been deactivated.
Anna: Well, then a lot of people are gonna die.
Damon: Where are they right now?
Anna: They're already here, Damon.


Vampire leader: Remember, we don't know which of them ingests vervain. It's not about the feed, it's about the kill. You know what to do.




Damon: Ric!
Alaric: Yeah?
Damon: You keep those nifty little vampire darts in the car?
Alaric: Yeah, why do you ask?
Damon: Because this square is crawling with tomb vampires. I think we might need a stake or two.
Alaric: Yeah, got it.


Elena: What are you doing?
Damon: Saving your life. Fifteen words or less...Tomb vamps are here. Founding families are their target.  Get her out of here, now!


Stefan: Wait, where are you going?
Damon: That's more than fifteen words, Stefan.


Elena: Wait, Jeremy is out here somewhere.
Stefan: Let's go find him, come on!
Mystic Grill


Caroline: There was this time, freshman year, when Bonnie and I were in a fight and we swore that we would never talk again.
Matt: Caroline, give it a rest.


Mayor Lockwood: What are you doing here? I told you to go home.
Tyler: I decided not to.
Mayor Lockwood: If I tell you to do something, you do it!


Tyler: Let go of me!


Caroline: Mayor, is everything okay?


Mayor Lockwood: Please Tyler; I need you to go home, now. Take your friends with you.
Matt: Why? What's going on?
Mayor Lockwood: I can't explain. All of you need to get home, now. Please.
Tyler: Yeah, okay.


Mayor Lockwood: Here, take my car, it's out back. Caroline, Matt go with him.




Jeremy: Anna what are you doing here? My uncle could see you.
Anna: I don't care about that. I needed to find you. Come here.


Town Square


Mayor Lockwood: For one hundred and fifty years, Mystic Falls has been the kind of town that everybody wants to call home: safe, prosperous, welcoming. And we have the Founders to thank for that. That's why I'd like to dedicate this evening's firework display to their legacy.


Grayson Gilbert's Office


John: Get in position.


Town Square
Mayor Lockwood: Enjoy the show!


Mayor Lockwood : Stay close.


Vampire leader: Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Bonnie: I'm sorry.


Grayson Gilbert's Office


Damon: Do you have any idea what you've done?
John: Yeah, as a matter of fact I do.


Town Square


Elena: Stefan, what's going on? What's happening?
Stefan: My head!
Elena: What?
Stefan: My head!!
Grayson Gilbert's Office


Mystic Grill


Jeremy: Anna what's wrong? Anna!
Anna: Please, make it stop!


Mystic Falls


Tyler: What the hell is that?
Caroline: What's the matter?
Tyler: That noise!
Matt: Wait, what noise?


Caroline: Tyler! Tyler!


Matt: Dude, hey! Caroline, the wheel!


Town Square


Alaric: Hey, I got this one. There's one over there. Take this, go! Go! Go!


Elena: I don't know what happened, he just dropped.
Alaric: Yeah, he's not the only one. The cops have gotten everyone who's gone down, injecting them with vervain.
Elena: What?


Elena: They're rounding up the vampires.


Mrs Lockwood: Please help him, he just went down.


Mystic Grill


Anna: Ahhhhhhhh my head!


Deputy : I got one.


Jeremy: Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, leave her alone!


Jeremy: Leave her alone! Anna!!!
Grayson Gilbert's Office


John: The device is done; the only thing keeping them down is vervain. We don't have much time, let's finish this.


John: Anna.


John : You can head up; I'll take it from here.


Anna: Please...no!


Town Square


Elena: Are you okay?
Stefan: It was like needles were piercing my skull and it just stopped.


Alaric: I saw at least five vampires go down. They're taking them to your family's old building.
Stefan: It's the Gilbert's device. It has to be.
Elena: But how did he get it to work? Bonnie unspelled it.
Alaric: Maybe she didn't.
Elena: She did, we saw her do it!
Stefan: No, no, no, he's right. Think about it. We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires.
Elena: So we could protect you.
Stefan: And Damon. Vampires. Where is Damon?
Alaric: I don't know. I haven't seen him since this started.
Elena: Can you get my brother, take him home?
Alaric: Of course.
Elena: Let's go.
Sheriff's Office


Mrs Lockwood: Liz, are you okay?
Sheriff Forbes: There's a key in my belt...
Mrs Lockwood: What's going on?!
Sheriff Forbes: There's a key in my belt, I need you to get it.


Mrs Lockwood: I've been looking everywhere for you, something happened to Richard. They took him.
Sheriff Forbes: Who took him?
Mrs Lockwood: Your deputies. I don't understand, he's not a vampire!


Sheriff Forbes: Let's go!
Grayson Gilbert's Office


Damon: Mayor. Is that you?
Mayor Lockwood: What are you doing here?
Damon: I'm a vampire. What's your excuse?  No, really. The vervain didn't affect you, you're not a vampire, what the hell are you?


Vampire leader: Mayor Lockwood!


Town Square


Matt: Hey, are you okay?
Caroline: I'm fine, I'm fine.
Matt: No, they need to check you out.
Caroline: No, I'm fine, I'm fine. They're helping Tyler.


Paramedic: What the hell?!
Matt: What's wrong?
Paramedic: His eyes!


Tyler: What happened?
Matt: Dude, don't scare me like that!


Matt: Caroline! Guys, over here! Caroline, wake up!


Stefan: Wait, wait, wait, I can hear them. The building is on fire.
Elena: What?
Stefan: The building's on fire!
Grayson Gilbert's Office


Town Square


Elena: Where is Damon?
John: With the rest of them, where he should be. It's over for Damon.
Elena: You're crazy!
John: Why? Because I'm doing what should have been done a hundred and forty five years ago? This is the right thing, Elena.


John: Go ahead, you won't make it out. It'll save me the trouble of killing you myself.


Stefan: You know the building well, is there another way in?
Elena: Utility door, there's one around the side.


John: You take one more step and I'll alert those deputies that they missed a vampire.
Elena: I'm asking you not to.
John: That doesn't mean anything to me.
Elena: As my father, it should.


John: You know.
Elena: I wasn't sure, now I am.


Grayson Gilbert's Office


Bonnie: Hey, you can't go in there!


Bonnie: The fire will take you out.
Stefan: He's my brother, Bonnie!


Elena: Stefan!
Bonnie: Elena, you can't go in there!
Elena: Bonnie, what are you doing?
Bonnie: I'm sorry I lied to you.


Bonnie: Ex spiritum intacullum, in terrum incendium, fes matos salvis adisdum!
Elena: Bonnie, I've got to get in there!


Stefan: Damon! Come on, hurry!


Elena: Bonnie...Bonnie, what is it? Are they gonna be okay?


Elena: Oh my god!
Mystic Grill


Elena: The fire is out. The story is the building's old wiring is what caused it.
Stefan: Did you see where Damon went?
Elena: No, he just kind of disappeared.
Stefan: Figures.


Elena: I'm so glad you're okay.
Stefan: I try so hard...to hate him. I guess it's just pointless.
Elena: You care about him, so do I. But I love you Stefan, and I know that you are worried about that.
Stefan: I just...you know, I know my brother.
Elena: But I love you, Stefan.
Stefan: I know the trouble he can cause.


Elena: I love you Stefan, you!


Elena: You have nothing to worry about, okay?


Elena: Jenna called, Jeremy's home, I'm just gonna run over to the school to pick up my dress, my clothes and the rest of my stuff and then I'll check on him.
Gilbert Residence


Jeremy: What are you doing here?
Damon: Anna's dead.
Jeremy: I figured that once they took her away.
Damon: I know you cared about her.
Jeremy: Yeah, I did.
Damon: I saw her killed. I was watching and all I could think about was...I wanted to help her, but I couldn't.
Jeremy: Why are you telling me all this?
Damon: I took away your suffering once before. I can do it again, but it's your choice.
Jeremy: Look, I know you think you took it away, but it's still there. Even if I can't remember why. I still feel empty, and alone, and making me forget won't fix it. It won't fix what's really wrong.
Damon: What I did to Vicki was wrong. I'm sorry for my part.
Jeremy: Anna said that vampires don't have to feel pain; that they could turn it off, if they shut out their humanity.
Damon: It's very true.
Jeremy: Is it easier that way?
Damon: Is what easier?
Jeremy: Life.
Damon: Life sucks either way, Jeremy. But, at least if you're a vampire, you don't have to feel bad about it if you don't want to.
Jeremy: Is that what you did?
Damon: I did it for a...I did it for a very long time and life was a lot easier.


Mystic Falls Hospital


Tyler: Hey man. I'm so sorry. Look, I don't even know what happened.
Matt: It's okay man. She'll be alright.


Matt: What's happening? Is she alright?
Sheriff Forbes: There was some internal bleeding; they're taking her into surgery.
Matt: What else did they say? Is she gonna be okay?
Sheriff Forbes: They're gonna do everything they can.


Sheriff Forbes: Tyler, have you talked to your mom?
Tyler: I left her a message telling her I was here.
Sheriff Forbes: You need to call her.
Tyler: What is it?
Sheriff Forbes: ...It's your dad.
Gilbert Residence


Mystic Grill


Stefan: Oh, hey.
Bonnie: Hey.
Stefan: You...you just missed Elena.
Bonnie: I was looking for you actually.
Stefan: Oh.
Bonnie: Elena is my best friend, and because she loves you, I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.
Stefan: I'm very grateful Bonnie, I hope you know that.
Bonnie: I do...but I hope you know that things have to change. Damon has to change.
Stefan: We both want the same thing.
Bonnie: We both want to protect the people we care about. The difference is, for you, Damon is one of them. You saw what I was able to do tonight. I know who I am now, and if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood, I'll take him down. Even if I have to take you with him.
Stefan: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Bonnie: Let's hope it doesn't.
Gilbert Residence


Elena: What are you doing here?
Damon: Failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing.
Elena: Which was...?
Damon: It's not important. Let me take this for you.


Elena: Thank you.
Damon: You know, I came to this town wanting to destroy it. Tonight, I found myself wanting to protect it. How does that happen? I'm not a hero, Elena. I don't do good. It's not in me.
Elena: Maybe it is.
Damon: Nah, it's reserved for my brother, and you...and Bonnie...who, even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.
Elena: Why do you sound so surprised?
Damon: Because she did it for you. Which means that somewhere along the way, you decided that I was worth saving. And I wanted to thank you for that.
Elena: You're welcome.


Elena: Hi...
Jenna: It's late, you should probably come inside.


Jenna: What are you doing?
Elena: I don't want to talk about it.






John: You scared me.
Elena: Sorry.
John: You know...I first met Isobel when I was a teenager. I fell in love with her instantly, although I'm pretty sure she never loved me. She was special. A part of why I hate the vampires so much is because of what she became, how it ruined her. And I never would have sent her to Damon had I known she wanted to turn.


John: It's my fault. I'm telling you this because I hoped maybe you'd understand.
Elena: Thank you.
John: Can I help?


Elena: Sure.


John: Katherine?!


Katherine: Hello, John. Goodbye, John.




Elena: I looked everywhere. Yeah, someone definitely took my stuff. I'm just gonna check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital. Can you meet me there? Okay. I love you Stefan.


Elena:  Jeremy?! Are you up?
