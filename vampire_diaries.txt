Woods

Stefan: [voice over] For over a century, I have lived in secret; hiding in the shadows, alone in the world. Until now. I am a vampire. And this is my story.
[Darren and Brooke are driving in their car through the woods.]

Darren: An hour's drive to hear that crap. You know, it wasn't even a band. A guy with a guitar. An hour each way.
Brooke: He wasn't that bad.
Darren: He sounded like James Blunt.
Brooke: What's wrong with that?
Darren: We already have a James Blunt. One's all we need.
Brooke: So why did you come?
Darren: Because I love you.
Brooke: Nicely done. What's with all the fog?
Darren: It'll clear in a second.
Brooke: Watch out!
[They run over a man.]

Darren: Are you okay?
Brooke: We just hit someone! Oh my god!
Darren: Call for help.
Brooke: Come on, come on!
Darren: Please be alive! Oh, my god.
[The man wakes up and bites him in the neck.]

Brooke: There's no signal! Darren! Darren?
[Brooke runs and gets dragged up into the sky.]

[TITLE: THE VAMPIRE DIARIES]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is on the roof.]

Stefan: I shouldn't have come home. I know the risk. But I had no choice. I have to know her.
[Jumps off roof]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is writing in her diary.]

Elena: Dear diary, today will be different. It has to be. I will smile, and it will be believable. My smile will say I'm fine, thank you. Yes, I feel much better. I will no longer be the sad little girl who lost her parents. I will start fresh, be someone new. It's the only way I'll make it through.
[In the kitchen.]

Jenna: Toast. I can make toast.
Elena: It's all about the coffee, Aunt Jenna.
Jeremy: Is there coffee?
Jenna: Your first day of school and I'm totally unprepared. Lunch money?
Elena: I'm good.
Jenna: Anything else? A number two pencil? What am I missing?
Elena: Don't you have a big presentation today?
Jenna: I'm meeting with my thesis advisor at...now. Crap!
Elena: Then go. We'll be fine. You okay?
Jeremy: Don't start.
[MISSING PERSONS: BROOKE AND DARREN BEHIND ELENA ON TV]

Bonnie's Car
[Elena and Bonnie are driving to school in Bonnie's car.]

Bonnie: So Grams is telling me I'm psychic. Our ancestors were from Salem, witches and all that, I know, crazy, but she's going on and on about it, and I'm like, put this woman in a home already! But then I started thinking, I predicted Obama and I predicted Heath Ledger, and I still think Florida will break off and turn into little resort islands...Elena! Back in the car.
Elena: I did it again, didn't I? I--I'm sorry, Bonnie. You were telling me that...
Bonnie: That I'm psychic now.
Elena: Right. Okay, then predict something. About me.
Bonnie: I see...
[A crow hits their car.]

Bonnie: What was that?! Oh, my god! Elena, are you okay?
Elena: It's okay. I'm fine.
Bonnie: It was like a bird or something. It came out of nowhere.
Elena: Really, I can't be freaked out by cars for the rest of my life.
Bonnie: I predict this year is going to be kick ass. And I predict all the sad and dark times are over and you are going to be beyond happy.
[A crow is on top of a road sign.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Stefan walks inside the school.]

[Inside the school.]

Bonnie: Major lack of male real estate. Look at the shower curtain on Kelly Beech. She looks like a hot ,  can I still say  tranny mess?
Elena: No, that's over.
Bonnie: Ahh, find a man, coin a phrase. It's a busy year.
[Elena waves to Matt. He ignores her.]

Elena: He hates me.
Bonnie: That's not hate. That's you dumped me, but I'm too cool to show it, but secretly I'm listening to Air Supply's greatest hits.
[Caroline approaches them.]

Caroline: Elena. Oh, my god.
[Caroline hugs Elena.]

Caroline: How are you? Oh, it's so good to see you. How is she? Is she good?
Elena: Caroline, I'm right here. And I'm fine. Thank you.
Caroline: Really?
Elena: Yes. Much better.
Caroline: Oh, you poor thing.
[Caroline hugs her again.]

Elena: Okay, Caroline.
Caroline: Oh! Okay, see you guys later?
Bonnie: OK! Bye!
Elena: No comment.
Bonnie: I'm not going to say anything.
[Outside the school.]

Jeremy: Don't take more than two in a six-hour window.
[Vicki takes the pills.]

Tyler: Hey, Vicki. I knew I'd find you here with the crackheads.
Vicki: Hey.
Tyler: Hey, Pete Wentz called. He wants his nail polish back.
Jeremy: Pete Wentz, huh? How old school T.R.L. of you. Carson Daly fan?
Vicki: Oh, Ty, be nice. That's Elena's little brother.
Tyler: I know who he is. I'll still kick his ass.
[Vicky and Tyler kiss]

[Outside the school office.]

Bonnie: Hold up. Who's this?
Elena: All I see is back.
Bonnie: It's a hot back.
[In the school office.]

Secretary: Your records are incomplete. You're missing immunization records, and we do insist on transcripts.
Stefan: Please look again. I'm sure everything you need is there.
[Stefan compels the secretary.]

Secretary: Well, you're right. So it is.
[Outside the school office.]

Bonnie: I'm sensing Seattle, and he plays the guitar.
Elena: You're really going to run this whole psychic thing into the ground, huh?
Bonnie: Pretty much.
Boy: Jeremy, good batch, man.
Elena: I'll be right back.
Bonnie: Please be hot.
[Elena enters the boy's bathroom.]

Boy: Whoa! Pants down, chick!
[Elena grabs Jeremy's face, looking into his eyes to see if he's high.]

Elena: Great. It's the first day of school and you're stoned.
Jeremy: No, I'm not.
Elena: Where is it? Is it on you?
Jeremy: Stop, all right?! You need to chill yourself, all right?
Elena: Chill myself? What is that, stoner talk? Dude, you are so cool.
Jeremy: Look, stop! I don't have anything on me. Are you crazy?
Elena: You haven't seen crazy, Jeremy! I gave you a summer pass, but I am done watching you destroy yourself. No, no, no, you know what? Go ahead. Keep it up. But just know that I am going to be there to ruin your buzz every time, you got it? Jeremy, I know who you are. And it's not this person. So don't be this person.
Jeremy: I don't need this.
[Jeremy leaves.]

[Outside the school office, Bonnie watches Stefan.]

Stefan: Thank you.
Secretary: You're welcome.
[Outside the boy's bathroom.]

Stefan: Uh, pardon me. Um...is this the men's room?
Elena: Yes. Um, I was just, Um, I was just, It's a long story....
[Elena tries to pass. Stefan makes way for her.]

Elena: Thank you.
[In the history class.]

Tanner: Once our home state of Virginia joined confederacy in 1861, it created a tremendous amount of tension within the state. People in Virginia's northwest region had different ideals than those from the traditional deep south. Then Virginia divided in 1863 with the northwest region joining the union. [continues talking]
[Elena and Stefan exchange looks.]

Bonnie [text to Elena]: HAWT-E. STARING at U.
[Elena looks at Stefan. She then looks back to the front.]

Cemetery
[Elena walks into the cemetery and writes in her diary.]

Elena: Dear diary, I made it through the day. I must have said, I'm fine, thanks, at least thirty-seven times. And I didn't mean it once. But no one noticed. When someone asks, How are you? They really don't want an answer.
[A crow appears on her parents grave stone.]

Elena: Okay. Hi, bird. That's not creepy or anything. Shoo!
[The bird flies off.]

Elena: That's what I thought.
[The crow reappears and fog starts to ascend around the cemetery. A man is standing behind a tomb. Elena starts to run.]

Elena: Ahh!
[Elena trips and falls. She gets up and sees Stefan.]

Stefan: You okay?
Elena: Were you following me?
Stefan: No, I-a, uh, I-a just ,  I saw you fall.
Elena: Uh-huh, and you just happened to be hanging out in a cemetery.
Stefan: I'm visiting. I have family here.
Elena: Oh. Wow. Tactless. I'm sorry. It's the fog, It's making me foggy. And then back there, there was this - this bird, and it was all very Hitchcock for a second. That is the bird movie, right, the Hitchcock?...I'm Elena.
Stefan: I'm Stefan.
Elena: I know. We have History together.
Stefan: And English and French.
Elena: Right.
[Stefan pulls a leaf out of Elena's hair.]

Elena: Thanks...Nice ring.
Stefan: Oh. Um, It's a family ring, yeah. I'm kinda stuck with it. It's weird, huh?
Elena: No, no. It's just, I mean, there are rings and then there's that.
Stefan: Did you hurt yourself?
Elena: Hmm?
Stefan: Did you hurt yourself?
Elena: Oh, uh, I don't know.
[Elena pulls up her pant leg and sees a cut gushing blood.]

Elena: Oh! Would you look at that. That is not pretty.
[Stefan turns around and his face changes].

Elena: Are you okay?
[Stefan's eyes start to change]

Stefan: You should go. Take care of that.
Elena: Really, it's nothing.
[She turns around but Stefan has disappeared.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is writing in his diary.]

Stefan: I lost control today. Everything I've kept buried inside came rushing to the surface. I'm simply not able to resist her.
Mystic Grill
Jeremy: Hey Vick.
Vicki: Working.
[She arrives at Matt and Tyler's table.]

Matt: Thanks, Vick.
Vicki: Do you need another refill?
Tyler: I'd love one.
[Vicki leaves the table.]

Matt: Please tell me you're not hooking up with my sister.
Tyler: I'm not hooking up with your sister.
Matt: You're such a dick.
[Jeremy catches up to Vicki.]

Jeremy: Hey, what's your deal? I mean, summer you act one way and then school starts and you can't be bothered.
Vicki: Look, Jeremy, I really appreciate all the pharmaceuticals, but you can't keep following me around like a lost puppy.
Jeremy: When's the last time you had sex with a puppy?
Vicki: Hey, keep it down. I don't want to tell the whole world I deflowered Elena's kid brother.
Jeremy: Yeah, and deflowered and deflowered.
Vicki: We hooked up a few times in a drug haze. It's over. You gotta back off before you ruin things between me and Tyler.
Jeremy: Oh,come on, the guy's a total douche. He only wants you for your ass.
Vicki: Yeah? What do you want me for?
[Caroline and Bonnie enter.]

Caroline: His name is Stefan Salvatore. He lives with uncle up at the old Salvatore Boarding House. He hasn't lived here since he was a kid. Military family, so they moved around a lot. He's a Gemini, and his favorite color is blue.
Bonnie: You got all of that in one day?
Caroline: Oh, please, I got all that between third and fourth period. We're planning a June wedding.
Gilbert Residence
Elena: I'm meeting Bonnie at the grill.
Jenna: Okay, have fun. Wait, I got this. Don't stay out late, it's a school night.
Elena: Well done, Aunt Jenna.
[She opens the door.]

Elena: Oh.
Stefan: Sorry, I was about to knock. I wanted to apologize for my disappearing act earlier. I know it was...strange.
Elena: No worries. I get it, blood makes you squeamish.
Stefan: Um, something like that. How's your leg?
Elena: Oh, it's fine. Just a scratch, barely. How did you know where I lived?
Stefan: It's a small town. I asked the first person I saw. Um, I thought you might want this back.
[He hands her her diary.]

Elena: Oh, I must have dropped it. I--thank you.
Stefan: Don't worry, I didn't...read it.
Elena: No? Why not? Most people would have.
Stefan: Well, I wouldn't want anyone to read mine.
Elena: You keep a journal?
Stefan: Yeah, if I don't write it down, I forget it. Memories are too important.
Elena: Yeah. I'm just gonna...umm, you don't have to stay out there.
[He tries to go in but he can't.]

Stefan: I'm fine. Sorry, were you going somewhere?
Elena: Yeah, I'm meeting a friend. Do you want to come?
Mystic Grill
Matt: How's Elena doing?
Bonnie: Her mom and dad died. How do you think? She's putting on a good face, but it's only been four months.
Matt: Has she said anything about me?
Bonnie: Oh, no. So not getting in the middle. You pick up the phone and call her.
Matt: I feel weird calling her. She broke up with me.
Bonnie: Give it more time, Matt.
[Elena enters with Stefan.]

Matt: More time, huh?
[He walks over to Elena and Stefan.]

Matt: Hey, I'm Matt, nice to meet you.
Stefan: Hi. Stefan.
Elena: Hey.
Matt: Hey.
Caroline: So, you were born in Mystic Falls?
Stefan: Mm-Hmm. And moved when I was still young.
Bonnie: Parents?
Stefan: My parents passed away.
Elena: I'm sorry. Any siblings?
Stefan: None that I talk to. I live with my uncle.
Caroline: So, Stefan, if you're new, then you don't know about the party tomorrow.
Bonnie: It's a back to school thing at the falls.
Stefan [to Elena]: Are you going?
Bonnie: Of course she is.
Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: You promised.
[Zach shows Stefan the newspaper article.]

Stefan: This was an animal attack.
Zach: Don't give me that. I know the game. You tear them up enough, they always suspect an animal attack. You said you had it under control.
Stefan: And I do.
Zach: Please, Uncle Stefan. Mystic Falls is a different place now. It's been quiet for years, but there are people who still remember. And you being here, it's just going to stir things up.
Stefan: It's not my intention.
Zach: Then what is? Why did you come back? After all this time, why now?
Stefan: I don't have to explain myself.
Zach: I know that you can't change what you are. But you don't belong here anymore.
Stefan: Where do I belong?
Zach: I can't tell you what to do. But coming back here was a mistake.
[Opens a door. Pulls out a journal with what looks to be a really old picture of Elena. The writing under the picture says Katherine 1864

Mystic Falls High School
[In history class.]

Tanner: The Battle of Willow Creek took place right at the end of the war in our very own Mystic Falls. How many casualties resulted in this battle? Ms. Bennett?
Bonnie: Um...a lot? I'm not sure. Like a whole lot.
Tanner: Cute becomes dumb in an instant, Ms. Bennett. Mr. Donovan? Would you like to take this opportunity to overcome your embedded jock stereotype?
Matt: It's okay, Mr. Tanner, I'm cool with it.
Tanner: Hmm. Elena? Surely you can enlighten us about one of the town's most significantly historical events?
Elena: I'm sorry, I--I don't know.
Tanner: I was willing to be lenient last year for obvious reasons, Elena. But the personal excuses ended with summer break.
Stefan: There were 346 casualties. Unless you're counting local civilians.
Tanner: That's correct. Mister...?
Stefan: Salvatore.
Tanner: Salvatore. Any relation to the original settlers here at Mystic Falls?
Stefan: Distant.
Tanner: Well, very good. Except, of course, there were no civilian casualties in this battle.
Stefan: Actually, there were 27, sir. Confederate soldiers, they fired on the church, believing it to be housing weapons. They were wrong. It was a night of great loss. The founder's archives are, uh, stored in civil hall if you'd like to brush up on your facts, Mr. Tanner.
Tanner: Hmm.
Woods
[Stefan arrives at the party and is listening for Elena.]

Bonnie: Just admit it, Elena.
Elena: Oh, okay, so he's a little pretty.
Bonnie: He has that romance novel stare.
[Caroline walks up to Stefan.]

Caroline: Hey! You made it!
Stefan: I did.
Caroline: Well, let's get you a drink.
Stefan: Well, I'm--
Caroline: Oh, come on.
[Bonnie and Elena are still talking.]

Bonnie: So where is he?
Elena: I don't know. You tell me, you're the psychic one.
Bonnie: Right, I forgot. Okay, so give me a sec. Grams says I have to concentrate.
Elena: Wait, you need a crystal ball.
[She gives her a bottle. Bonnie takes it and touches Elena's hand. Bonnie spaces out for a while, comes back to her senses, and abruptly pulls her hand back.]

Elena: What?
Bonnie: That was weird. When I touched you, I saw a crow.
Elena: What?
Bonnie: A crow. There was fog, a man. I'm drunk. It's the drinking. There's nothing psychic about it. Yeah? Ok, I'm gonna get a refill.
[Bonnie leaves Elena alone.]

Elena: Okay? Bonnie!
[She turns around Stefan is behind her.]

Stefan: Hi.
Elena: Hi.
Stefan: I did it again, didn't it?
Elena: Yeah.
Stefan: I'm sorry. You're upset about something.
Elena: Oh, uh, no, it's- it's just Bonnie. She's...You know what? Never mind. You're...here.
Stefan: I'm here.
[Bridge near the party.]

Elena: You know, you're kind of the talk of the town.
Stefan: Am I?
Elena: Mmm hmm. Mysterious new guy, oh, yeah.
Stefan: Well, you have the mysterious thing going, too. Twinged in sadness.
Elena: What makes you think that I'm sad?
Stefan: Well, we did meet in a graveyard.
Elena: Right. Well, no, technically we met in the men's room. You don't want to know, it's....it's not exactly party chit-chat.
Stefan: Well, I've never really been very good at, uh, chit-chat.
Elena: Last spring. . my parents' car drove off of a bridge into the lake. And I was in the backseat and I survived, but...they didn't. So that's my story.
Stefan: You won't be sad forever, Elena.
[Woods by the party.]

Vicki: No, Ty. I'm not having sex against a tree.
Tyler: Oh, come on, it would be hot.
Vicki: For who? No, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen, not here, not like this. No. I said no. I said no! Ow, that hurts!
[Jeremy appears.]

Jeremy: Hey, leave her alone!
Tyler: You know, you're starting to get on my nerves, Gilbert.
Vicki: Just go, Tyler, get the hell away from me.
Tyler: Wow. Vicki Donovan says no. That's a first.
[Tyler leaves.]

Vicki: I didn't need your help.
Jeremy: It seems like you did.
Vicki: He was just drunk.
Jeremy: I'm drunk. Am I throwing myself at you?
Vicki: No, you're worse. You want to talk to me, get to know me, see into my soul and screw and screw and screw until you're done with me.
Jeremy: Is that what you think?
Vicki: That's what I know.
[Bridge by the party.]

Stefan: I like Bonnie, she seems like a good friend.
Elena: Best friend in the world.
Stefan: And Matt, he can't seem to, uh, take his eyes off of us.
Elena: Matt's that friend since childhood that you start dating because you owe it to yourselves to see if you can be more.
Stefan: And?
Elena: And then my parents died, and everything changes. Anyway, Matt and I, together we just, I don't know, it wasn't, um...it wasn't...
Stefan: Passionate?
Elena: No. No, it wasn't passionate...
[Stefan's eyes start to change.]

Elena: Hey, um, are you okay? Um, Your eye, it just, it's--
Stefan: Oh, um...Yeah, no. It's, um, it's nothing. Um, are you thirsty? I'm gonna get us a drink.
[He leaves.]

[Near the party.]

Vicki: Jeremy? Is that you?...Jeremy?
[Fog descends around her. A man is standing behind her. She is attacked.]

[At the party.]

Matt: Looking for someone?
Elena: Hey.
Matt: When you broke up with me, you said it was because you needed some time alone. You don't look so alone to me.
Elena: Matt, you don't understand. It's--
Matt: That's okay, Elena. You do what you have to do. I just want to let you know that...I still believe in us. And I'm not giving up on that.
Elena: Matt...
Caroline: Hey! There you are. Have you been down to the falls yet? Because they are really cool at night. And I can show you...if you want.
Stefan: I think you've had too much to drink.
Caroline: Well, of course I have. So, 
Stefan: Caroline. You and me, it's not gonna happen. Sorry.
[Stefan approaches Elena.]

Elena: I was wondering who abducted you, but now I know.
Stefan: Is she like that with, uh, all the guys?
Elena: No. You're fresh meat. She'll back off eventually. Hmm. God, you gotta be kidding me!
Stefan: What is it?
Elena: My brother.
Stefan: The drunk one?
Elena: That would be the one. Excuse me.
Stefan: Need some help?
Elena: Trust me, you're not going to want to witness this. Jeremy! Jeremy!
[In the woods.]

Elena: Jeremy, where the hell are you going?
Jeremy: I don't want to hear it!
Elena: Yeah, well, too bad!
[Jeremy trips. He sees Vicki's body, she's been bitten.]

Jeremy: Vicki? No! Oh, my god, it's Vicki!
Elena: Oh, my god!
Jeremy: No!
[At the party.]

Elena: Somebody help!
Matt: Vicki? Vicki, what the hell?!
Tyler: What happened to her?
Matt: Somebody, call an ambulance!
Tyler: Everybody back up, give her some space!
Elena: It's her neck. Something bit her. She's losing a lot of blood.
Boy: Put this on her neck.
Matt: Vicki, Vicki, come on, open your eyes, look at me.
Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: What's going on?
Stefan: Someone else was attacked tonight, Zach, and it wasn't me.
[Stefan enters his bedroom. A crow appears.]

Stefan: Damon.
[A man is standing on the balcony.]

Damon: Hello, brother.
Stefan: Crow's a bit much, don't you think?
Damon: Wait till you see what I can do with the fog.
Stefan: When'd you get here?
Damon: Well, I couldn't miss your first day at school. Your hair's different. I like it.
Stefan: It's been 15 years, Damon.
Damon: Thank God. I couldn't take another day of the nineties. That horrible grunge look? Did not suit you. Remember, Stefan, it's important to stay away from fads.
Stefan: Why are you here?
Damon: I miss my little brother.
Stefan: You hate small towns. It's boring. There's nothing for you to do.
Damon: I've managed to keep myself busy.
Stefan: You know, you left that girl alive tonight. That's very clumsy of you.
Damon: Ah. That can be a problem...for you.
Stefan: Why are you here now?
Damon: I could ask you the same question. However, I'm fairly certain your answer can be summed up all into one little word...Elena.
Woods
[Matt leaves by ambulance with Vicky.]

Bonnie: Hey. We're gonna go to Mainline Coffee, wait for news.
Elena: I gotta take Jeremy home.
Bonnie: Elena, there's no way I'm psychic. I know that. But whatever I saw, or I think I saw, I have this feeling...
Elena: Bonnie, what?
Bonnie: That it's just the beginning.
Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: She took my breath away. Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine. Is it working, Stefan? Being around her, being in her world? Does it make you feel alive?
Stefan: She's not Katherine.
Damon: Well, let's hope not. We both know how that ended. Tell me something, when's the last time you had something stronger than a squirrel?
Stefan: I know what you're doing, Damon. It's not gonna work.
Damon: Yeah? Come on. Don't you crave a little?
[Damon starts hitting Stefan.]

Stefan: Stop it.
Damon: Let's do it. Together. I saw a couple girls out there. Or just, let's just cut to the chase, let's just go straight for Elena.
Stefan: Stop it!
Damon: Imagine what her blood tastes like!
[Stefan's face transforms.]

Damon: I can.
Stefan: I said stop!
[Stefan runs into Damon, throwing him out of the window. When he lands on the pavement, Damon isn't there.]

Damon: I was impressed. I give it a six. Missing style, but I was pleasantly surprised. Very good with the whole face...thing. It was good.
Stefan: You know, it's all fun and games, Damon, huh? But wherever you go, people die.
Damon: That's a given.
Stefan: Not here. I won't allow it.
Damon: I take that as an invitation.
Stefan: Damon, please. After all these years, can't we just give it a rest?
Damon: I promised you an eternity of misery, so I'm just keeping my word.
Stefan: Just stay away from Elena.
Damon: Where's your ring? Oh, yeah, sun's coming up in a couple of hours, and, poof, ashes to ashes. Relax. It's right here.
[Damon grabs Stefan by the throat and throws him against the garage.]

Damon: You should know better than to think you're stronger than me. You lost that fight when you stopped feeding on people. I wouldn't try it again. I think we woke Zach up. Sorry, Zach.
Woods
[Jeremy is drinking a beer. Elena arrives.]

Elena: You okay? I called Jenna, she's on her way. Those people in uniforms, last time I checked, they're the police. People are going to stop giving you breaks, Jer. They just don't care anymore. They don't remember that our parents are dead, because they've got their own lives to deal with. The rest of the world has moved on. You should try, too.
Jeremy: I've seen you in the cemetery writing in your diary. Is that--is that supposed to be you moving on?
Elena: Mom and Dad wouldn't have wanted this.
Mystic Grill
Bonnie: Are you sober yet?
Caroline: No.
Bonnie: Keep drinking. I gotta get you home. I gotta get me home.
Caroline: Why didn't he go for me? You know, how come the guys that I want never want me?
Bonnie: I'm not touching that.
Caroline: I'm inappropriate. I always say the wrong thing. And...Elena always says the right thing. She doesn't even try! And he just picks her. And she's always the one that everyone picks, for everything. And I try so hard, and...I'm never the one.
Bonnie: It's not a competition, Caroline.
Caroline: Yeah, it is.
Hospital
[Matt is sitting at the hospital with Vicki. Vicki wakes up.]

Matt: Vicki...Hey. Hey, it's okay. You're gonna be okay.
Vicki: Matt--
Matt: Hey, don't try to talk, okay? You're fine.
Vicki: Vampire.

Gilbert Residence and Salvatore Boarding House
Elena: Dear diary, I couldn't have been more wrong. I thought that I could smile, nod my way through it; pretend like it would all be ok.
Stefan: I had a plan. I wanted to change who I was; create a life as someone new, someone without the past.
Elena: Without the pain.
Elena and Stefan: Someone alive.
Elena: But it's not that easy. The bad things stay with you.
Stefan: They follow you.
Mystic Grill
[Caroline is alone at the table. Damon looks at her.]

Stefan: [voiceover] You can't escape them, as much as you want to.
[Damon smiles at Caroline. She smiles back.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is in her bedroom.]

Elena: All you can do is be ready for the good. So when it comes, you invite it in, because you need it. I need it.
[Elena sees Stefan outside her window.]

Stefan: I know it's late. But, uh...I needed to know that you were ok.
Elena: You know, for months, that's all anyone's wondered about me. If I'll be ok.
Stefan: What do you tell them?
Elena: That I'll be fine.
Stefan: Do you ever mean it?
Elena: Ask me tomorrow. It's warmer in the house. We can talk. Would you like to come in?
Stefan: Yes.
[Stefan enters Elena's house.]

Woods
[A man and a woman are camping in the forest. Fog descends around the tent.]

Woman: Hey. Did you hear that?
Man: Hear what?
Woman: I heard thunder.
Man: There's no thunder.
Woman: Are you sure? Because if it rains, then we won't be able to see the comet.
Man: It's not gonna rain. Listen, I...got you a little something. It's back in the car. Don't you move.
Woman: Stay dry.
Man: It's not gonna rain.
[A dripping noise pounds on the tent after the man leaves. The woman smiles triumphantly.]

Woman: I knew it! I told you it was gonna rain!
[She sees her boyfriend up in a tree. His blood dripping on the tent. She runs to the car.]

Woman: Open! No! Please!
[The car beeps as the doors unlock. The woman looks around nervously. Someone drops from the trees and kills her.]

[Title credits]

Gilbert Residence and Salvatore Boarding House
Elena: Dear diary, this morning is...different. There is change. I can sense it, feel it.
Stefan: I'm awake. For the first time in a long time, I feel completely and undeniably wide awake.
Elena: For once, I don't regret the day before it begins.
Stefan: I welcome the day...
Stefan and Elena: Because I know...
Stefan: I will see her again.
Elena: I will see him again. For the first time in a long time, I feel good.
[Elena goes out of her room.]

Gilbert Residence
Jenna: Do I look adult? As in respectfully parental?
Elena: Depends on where you're going.
Jenna: Jeremy's parent-teacher conference. Hair up or down?
[Jenna puts her hair up.]

Elena: Sexy stewardess.
[Jenna lets it down.]

Elena: Boozy housewife.
Jenna: Up it is. You're feisty today.
Elena: I feel good, which is rare. So I've decided to go with it. Fly free, walk on the sunshine, and all that stuff. Where is Jeremy?
Jenna: He left early. Something about getting to wood shop early to finish a birdhouse.
[She pauses.]

Jenna: There is no wood shop, is there?
Elena: No.
Jenna: Yeah.
Hospital
[Jeremy stands outside Vicki's room.]

Nurse: You can't be in here, hon. Visiting hours don't start till 9:00.
Jeremy: I just...how is she?
Nurse: She's lost a lot of blood.
Jeremy: Yeah, but she's gonna be OK, right?
Nurse: She needs her rest. So you come back later. Come on.
Mystic Falls High School
[In history class, Elena and Stefan look at each other while their teacher lectures.]

Tanner: Originally discovered nearly 5 centuries ago, it hasn't been over Mystic Falls in over 145 years. Now, the comet will be its brightest right after dusk during tomorrow's celebration. Are we bothering you, Mr. Salvatore? Ms. Gilbert?
[Elena and Stefan drop their gazes. The bell rings.]

[In the hallway.]

Stefan: I brought it. [Hands Elena a book.] Told you.
Elena: Wuthering Heights by Ellis Bell. You know, I can't believe she didn't use her real name.
Stefan: All the Bronte sisters used pseudonyms. It was the time. Female writers weren't very accepted then.
Elena: Where did you get it?
Stefan: Uh, it was passed down. Through the family.
Elena: Ah.
Stefan: I have lots of books. Go ahead. Keep it.
Elena: Oh, no. I...but I would like to read it again. I promise I'll give it back.
Stefan: Ok.
Caroline: I'm confused. Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
Bonnie: Technically, Grams says I'm a witch. My ancestors were these really cool Salem witch chicks or something. Grams tried to explain it all, but she was looped on the liquor so I kinda tuned out. Crazy family, yes. Witches? I don't think so.
Caroline: Yeah, well, feel free to conjure up the name and number of that guy from last night.
Bonnie: I didn't see him, you did. Why didn't you just talk to him?
Caroline: I don't know. I was drunk.
[Ouside, Jeremy walks up to Tyler.]

Jeremy: Hey, Tyler. Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt. I was just wondering how Vicki's doing, since you guys are so close. Is she ok?
Tyler: She's fine. Now get out of here.
Jeremy: How bad is she? Do they know what attacked her? Is she going to make a full recovery? Was she happy to see you? What room number was she in?
Tyler: I'm gonna kick your ass.
Jeremy: Yeah, you keep saying that, but when are you actually going to do it? Huh? 'Cause I vote for right here and right now.
[Jeremy shoves Tyler.]

Tyler: Walk away, Gilbert. It's your final warning.
Jeremy: No, this is your final warning, dick. I'm sick of watching you play Vicki. If you hurt her one more time, I swear to God, I will kill you.
[Jeremy leaves.]

Tyler: Damn, that was like a death threat. [He turns to the girls beside him.] Did you hear that?
[Matt and Elena talk about Vicki.]

Matt: They're keeping her overnight to make sure there's no infection, but she should be able to come home tomorrow.
Elena: That's good news.
Matt: Yeah.
Elena: Did you get in touch with your mom?
Matt: Called and left a message. She's in Virginia Beach with her boyfriend, so...we'll see how long it takes her to come rushing home.
Elena: Vicki's lucky that she's ok.
[Stefan is sitting on a table revealing that he has been listening to their entire conversation.]

Matt: I know, and now there's talk of some missing campers.
Elena: Did she say what kind of animal it was that attacked her?
Matt: She said it was a vampire.
Elena: What?
Matt: Yeah, she wakes up last night and mutters vampire and then passes out.
Elena: OK, that is weird.
Matt: I think she was drunk. So what's up with you and the new guy?
Elena: Matt, the last thing that I want to do is hurt you.
Matt: You know, I'm...I'm actually gonna go back to the hospital. I want to be there when Vicki wakes up, get the real story about last night.
[Stefan disappears.]

[Jenna talks to Mr. Tanner in the history classroom.]

Tanner: As Jeremy's teacher, I'm concerned. All right? It's the third day of school and he's skipped six of his classes.
Jenna: Mr. Tanner, are you aware that Jeremy and Elena's parents died?
Tanner: Four months ago, a great loss. Car accident. Wickery bridge, if I remember correctly. And you're related to the family how? The, uh, mother's kid sister?
Jenna: Younger sister.
Tanner: Right.
Jenna: Yes. Six classes? Are you sure? I mean, that's kind of hard to do.
Tanner: Not when you're on drugs. It's his attempt at coping, Ms. Sommers. And the signs are there. He's moody, withdrawn, argumentative, hungover. Are there any other relatives in the picture?
Jenna: I'm their sole guardian.
Tanner: Uh-huh. Could there be?
Jenna: What are you suggesting, exactly?
Tanner: It's an impossible job, isn't it, raising two teens?
Jenna: It's been tough, but, no, it's not.
Tanner: Wrong answer. It is an extremely impossible job, and anything less and you're not doing it properly.
Hospital
[Matt is waiting with Vicki. She wakes up.]

Matt: Whoa! Vick. Vicki, hey. Vick, it's Matt. Hey, what's wrong?
Vicki: No! No! Get off! No! No! No!
Matt: Nurse!
[Matt goes to look for a doctor. Stefan enters the hospital room and compels her.]

Stefan: It was an animal that attacked you. It came out of the night and jumped you. You blacked out. It's all you remember.
Vicki: It's all I remember.
Stefan: An animal attacked you. You blacked out. It's all you remember.
Vicki: It's all I remember.
Matt: Nurse! I need help! It's my sister.
Nurse: She seems fine.
[Vicki is back in bed. Matt sees Stefan leaving. He follows Stefan. Stefan enters a room with blood donors and blood bags. His face starts to change, but he leaves as quickly as possible. Matt enters the same room. He looks for Stefan but does not find him.]

Mystic Grill
Bonnie: Well, I was talking to Grams, and she said the comet is a sign of impending doom. The last time it passed over Mystic Falls, there was lots of death. So much blood and carnage, it created a bed of paranormal activity.
Caroline: Yeah, and then you poured Grams another shot and she told you about the aliens. So then what
Elena: So then nothing.
Caroline: You and Stefan talked all night? There was no sloppy first kiss or touchy feely of any kind?
Elena: Nope. We didn't go there.
Caroline: Not even a handshake? I mean, Elena, we are your friends. Ok? You are supposed to share the smut.
Elena: We just talked for hours.
Caroline: OK, what is with the blockage? Just jump his bones already! Ok, it's easy. Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, sex!
Elena: Profound.
[Elena gets up.]

Bonnie: Where are you going?
Elena: Caroline's right. It is easy. If I sit here long enough, I'll end up talking myself out of it instead of doing what I started the day saying what I was going to do.
Gilbert Residence
Jenna: I picked up dinner. Tacos. I had an urge for guacamole.
Jeremy: No, I'm good, thanks.
Jenna: Eat anyway. It's a ruse. I want to talk.
[Jeremy starts to leave.]

Jenna: Hey, you! Come. Sit. [Jeremy sits down] Back in school, freshman year, I could eat my weight in nachos, with extra cheese. It was my munchie food whenever I got stoned.
Jeremy: You get high?
Jenna: Did. Past tense. But, yeah. Loved it. Anything to get a little distraction from life...reality. And it worked. For a while. Never lasts, though. Hey, I'm not saying I wouldn't love to rail back and kick it, but with a thesis looming and a waistline expanding...
[Jeremy gets up and leaves when Jenna isn't looking. Jenna notices and she sighs.]

Hospital
[Matt is sleeping on a chair. Vicki wakes up. She throws a gelatin container at Matt. Matt stirs.]

Matt: What the...
Vicki: Finally you're awake.
Matt: Hey. How are you feeling? You look better. I was worried before. You really had me freaked out with all that screaming.
Vicki: Wait, what are you talking about?
Matt: You don't remember?
Vicki: I feel fine.
Matt: Good, good. Doctor said you could come home tomorrow. Vick, what attacked you in the woods?
[Vicki hesitates.]

Vicki: An animal. What else could it have been?
[Jeremy arrives.]

Jeremy: Hey. How do you feel?
Vicki: I'm OK.
Matt: I...I'm gonna...I'm gonna go grab a coffee. Hey, Jer.
Vicki: Why are you here?
Jeremy: I just wanted to see how you were doing.
Vicki: Did you see that look on Matt's face? That was suspicion. I don't want people to find out about us, Jeremy.
Jeremy: Well, you gotta get over that.
Vicki: Tyler is finally showing some interest.
Jeremy: You have to get over that, too. Do you see Mr. Concerned? Tyler? Are you under there? No.
Vicki: It's not cool for people to know. Ok? I'm older than you, and Matt and Elena would freak.
Jeremy: No one's going to suspect anything. Why wouldn't I check on you? I mean, I'm the one who found you.
Vicki: You are?
Jeremy: Yeah, I carried you out of the woods.
Vicki: Thank you.
Jeremy: Yeah, you're welcome.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena goes to the front door and knocks, it opens and she enters.]

Elena: Stefan? Stefan?
[A crow flies into the house. Elena turns around and Damon is standing there.]

Elena: I...I'm sorry for barging in. The door was...open.
Damon: You must be Elena. I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.
Elena: He didn't tell me he had a brother.
Damon: Well, Stefan's not one to brag. Please, come. I'm sure Stefan will be along any second.
Elena: Wow. This is your living room?
Damon: Living room, parlor, Sotheby's auction. It's a little kitschy for my taste. I see why my brother's so smitten. It's about time. For a while there, I never thought he'd get over the last one. Nearly destroyed him.
Elena: The last one?
Damon: Yeah. Katherine, his girlfriend? Oh, you two haven't had the awkward exes conversation yet.
Elena: Nope.
Damon: Oops. Well, I'm sure it'll come up now. Or maybe he didn't want to tell you because he didn't want you to think he was on the rebound. We all know how those relationships end.
Elena: You say it like every relationship is doomed to end.
Damon: I'm a fatalist. Hello, Stefan.
Stefan: Elena. I didn't know you were coming over.
Elena: I know. I should have called, I just...
Damon: Oh, don't be silly. You're welcome any time. Isn't she, Stefan? You know, I should break out the family photo albums or some home movies. But...I have to warn you. He wasn't always such a looker.
Stefan: Thank you for stopping by, Elena. Nice to see you.
Elena: Yeah, I should probably go. It was nice to meet you, Damon.
Damon: Great meeting you, too, Elena.
[Stefan is blocking Elena's way as he stares at Damon.]

Elena: Stefan....Stefan?
[Stefan moves; Elena leaves.]

Damon: Great gal. Whoo. She's got spunk. You, on the other hand, look pooped. Did you over-exert yourself today? Let me guess...hospital.
Stefan: Someone had to clean up your mess.
Damon: Well, were you successful? Did the powers of persuasion work? Remember, if you don't feed properly, none of those little tricks work right.
Stefan: How long was Elena here?
Damon: Were you worried, Stefan? Scared we may be doomed to repeat the past? Isn't that why you play your little game, I'm a high school human?
Stefan: I'm not playing any game.
Damon: Of course you are. We both know the closest you'll ever get to humanity is when you rip it open and feed on it.
Stefan: What kind of game are you playing, Damon?
Damon: Guess you'll just have to wait and see, won't you?
Gilbert Residence
Elena: He's on the rebound and has raging family issues.
Jenna: Well, at least it's an ex-girlfriend. Wait till you date a guy with mommy issues or cheating issues. Or amphetamine issues.
[Jeremy enters the house.]

Jenna: Jeremy? Jeremy, where were you?
Jeremy: More stoner stories? Look, Jenna, I get it, you were cool. And so that's...that's cool.
Jenna: Oh, no, no, no!
[Jenna throws an apple at Jeremy.]

Jeremy: Ow! Why? Why...why did you do that?
Jenna: Listen up! Quit ditching class or you're grounded. No discussion.
Jeremy: Parental authority, I like it. Sleep tight.
Hospital
[Vicki wakes up. She looks at Matt and sees him sleeping in a chair. She goes into the bathroom to wash her hands, when she looks into the mirror she sees a glimpse of Damon.]

Vicki: Matt. Mattie?
[Matt turns into Damon with his vampire face. She wakes up from the nightmare.]

Mystic Falls Town Square
[Elena and Bonnie are handing out pamphlets.]

Bonnie: Tonight, night of the comet! Would you like a program?
[She turns to Elena.]

Bonnie: Would you like a program? He didn't call, huh?
Elena: Or text. But I realized we never even exchanged that stuff. We've never gotten to the texting part.
Bonnie: That's an important milestone in any relationship.
Elena: Isn't it? The timing is wrong, anyway.
Bonnie: When is it ever right?
Elena: I'm not ready, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Who is?
Elena: At least I put myself out there.
Bonnie: Is that what you're calling it?
Elena: What do you mean?
Bonnie: All I'm hearing is reasons why you can't.
[Caroline sees Damon and approaches him. When she gets closer, he's gone.]

Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: What is Damon doing here? Why did he come home?
Stefan: 'Cause I came home. He wants to make my life miserable. That's how he enjoys his.
Zach: Well, he's putting us all at risk. This girl in the hospital could talk.
Stefan: She won't. I took care of her.
Zach: You're sure?
Stefan: I'm not sure, Zach. I don't know how well it worked. I'm not as strong as Damon.
Zach: So what happens if it doesn't work?
Stefan: I don't know. I'll deal with it.
Zach: Is she worth it? Uncle Stefan, this girl you came back for?
Mystic Grill
Jeremy: Vicki, what are you doing here?
Vicki: Fighting with Robert about my schedule. You'd think getting ripped up by a rabid animal would merit an extra sick day.
Jeremy: Are you feeling ok?
Vicki: I hurt.
Jeremy: Well, the doctor gave you something, right?
Vicki: The kid stuff. Nothing with an o in it. I think they were on to me.
[They laugh. Jeremy gives her pills.]

Jeremy: Here. Knock yourself out, literally.
Vicki: Thanks, Jer.
Jeremy: So you gonna, uh, watch the comet later?
Vicki: I hadn't really thought about it. But I could be talked into it. I'll meet you out there in a few.
[Tyler approaches them.]

Tyler: Hey, Vick. How you feeling?
Vicki: Like you care.
[Vicki leaves. Tyler catches Jeremy looking at him in a mocking manner.]

Tyler: What are you lookin' at, Gilbert?
Mystic Falls Town Square
Caroline: Hey, I got some candles.
Elena: Hi. Hey.
Matt: Hey.
[Matt lights Elena's candle.]

Elena: Thank you.
Matt: You're welcome.
[Elena lights someone else's candle. She looks up and sees Stefan.]

Stefan: Thank you. Hi.
Elena: Hi.
Stefan: You know, that comet...it's been traveling across space for thousands of years. All alone.
Elena: Yeah, Bonnie says it's a harbinger of evil.
Stefan: I think it's just a ball of...snow and ice, trapped on a path that it can't escape. And once every 145 years, it gets to come home. I'm sorry about yesterday. I wasn't myself.
Elena: You seem to spend a lot of time apologizing.
Stefan: Well, I have a lot to apologize for. Yesterday, that wasn't about you, ok?
Elena: You didn't tell me that you had a brother.
Stefan: We're not close. It's, uh...it's complicated.
Elena: Always. He told me about your ex. Katherine.
Stefan: What did he say?
Elena: That she broke your heart.
Stefan: That was a long time ago.
Elena: When you lose someone, it stays with you, always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt.
Stefan: Elena...
Elena: It's OK, Stefan. I get it. You have no idea how much I get it. Complicated brother? Check. Complicated ex? Check. Too complicated to even contemplate dating, double check. It's OK. We met, and we talked, and it was epic, but...then the sun came up and reality set in. So...
[Elena blows out her candle and walks away.]

Mystic Grill
[Vicki sees Damon and walks over to him.]

Vicki: I know you.
Damon: Well, that's unfortunate.
Vicki: Um...I don't...I don't know how, but...your face. Excuse me. Sorry.
[Vicki goes into the restroom and takes some pills. When she looks up into the mirror, Damon is behind her and attacks her. She screams.]

Jeremy: Hey, has anyone seen Vicki?
Tyler: You're her stalker. You tell us.
Jeremy: I can't find her.
Tyler: She probably found somebody else to party with. Sorry, pill pusher, I guess you've been replaced.
Elena: What's with the pill pusher?
Tyler: Ask him.
Jeremy: You wanna do this right now?
Elena: Are you dealing?
Tyler: She's never gonna go for you.
Jeremy: She already did. Over and over and over again.
Tyler: Yeah, right.
Caroline: You slept with Vicki Donovan? I mean, Vicki Donovan slept with you?
Tyler: There's no way.
Jeremy: And I didn't even have to force her into it.
Matt: What the hell is he talking about, Ty?
Tyler: Nothing, man, just ignore him, he's a punk.
Matt: You know what, how about all of you shut up and help me find my sister?
Bonnie: We'll check the back.
Matt: I'll check the square.
Jeremy: I'll come with you.
Elena: Oh, no, no, no. You are coming with me. So that's your game now, dealing?
Jeremy: I'm not dealing.
Elena: Look, I'm sick of the tough love speech, Jer. It's clearly having no impact.
Jeremy: You and Jenna, between the two of you. Enough already!
Elena: We can stop if you want. Send you to a therapist where you'll be forced to deal with it or to rehab where you'll sit in group and tell some stranger how you let your life fall apart. Or you could talk to me.
Jeremy: I vote for none of the above.
Street
Matt: Hey.
Stefan: Hey.
Matt: Have you seen my sister?
Stefan: No, sorry.
Matt: I can't find her. She's missing.
Stefan: I'll keep an eye out for her.
[Stefan starts to leave.]

Matt: Hey. I saw you at the hospital yesterday.
Stefan: Did you?
Matt: What were you doing there?
Stefan: Visiting.
Matt: Visiting? You know, Elena and I, we've known each other for a long time. We might not be together right now, but I look out for her. And I'll always look out for her.
[Stefan hears a scream nearby, followed by Damon and Vicki's voices.]

Damon: You really have to stop screaming.
Vicki: No, please, stop. Don't...
Damon: Shh. I got you...
Stefan: Excuse me.
[He leaves.]

[Stefan sees Damon and Vicki. He jumps on the roof.]

Vicki: No! No!
Damon: Shh, I'm not gonna drop you.
Damon [to Stefan]: Not bad. Have you been eating bunnies?
Stefan: Let her go.
Damon: Shh. really? Ok. Damon pulls Vicki to the edge of the roof.]
Vicki: No!
Stefan: No, no, no!
[Damon throws Vicki to Stefan.]

Damon: Ugh! Relax.
Vicki: What's happening?
Damon [to Stefan]: I don't need her to be dead, but...you might.
Damon [to Vicki]: What attacked you the other night?
Vicki: I don't know. An animal.
Damon: Are you sure about that? Think. Think about it. Think really hard. What attacked you?
Vicki: A vampire.
Damon: Who did this to you?
Vicki: You did!
Damon: Wrong!
Stefan: Don't.
Damon: It was Stefan.
Stefan: Don't.
Damon: Come here.
[Damon grabs Vicki on both sides of her head.]

Damon: Stefan Salvatore did this to you.
Vicki: Stefan Salvatore did this to me.
Damon: He's a vampire. A vicious, murderous monster.
Stefan: Please, Damon. Please don't do this.
Damon: If you couldn't fix it before, I don't know what you can do now.
[Damon pulls off Vicki's bandage and throws her to Stefan.]

Vicki: Aah!
Damon: Ugh! Your choice of lifestyle has made you weak. A couple of vampire parlor tricks is nothing compared to the power that you could have, that you now need. But you can change that. Human blood gives you that.
Vicki: No!
Damon: You have two choices. You can feed and make her forget. Or you can let her run, screaming vampire through the town square.
Stefan: That's what this is about? You want to expose me?
Damon: No! I want you to remember who you are!
Stefan: Why? So what, so I'll feed? So I'll kill? So I'll remember what it's like to be brothers again? You know what, let her go. Let her tell everyone that vampires have returned to Mystic Falls. Let them chain me up, and let them drive a stake through my heart, because at least I'll be free of you.
Damon: Huh. Huh. Wow. Come here, sweetheart.
Vicki: No!
Damon: It's OK.
[Damon whispers something into Vicki's ear and she becomes fine.]

Vicki: What happened? Where am I? Oh, I ripped my stitches open. Ugh...
Stefan: You Okay?
Vicki: I took some pills, man. I'm good.
[Vicki leaves.]

Damon: It's good to be home. Think I might stay a while. This town could use a bit of a wake-up call, don't you think?
Stefan: What are you up to, Damon?
Damon: That's for me to know and for you to...dot dot dot. Give Elena my best.
Mystic Grill
[Matt helps Vicki with her bandage.]

Matt: She said you found her wandering around.
Stefan: Yeah.
Matt: So, um, thanks.
[Caroline and Bonnie are seated at another table.]

Caroline: Ugh, it's just so much drama. Ever notice how the druggies are the biggest attention whores?
Bonnie: Yeah.
Stefan: Excuse me. Hi.
Bonnie: Hi.
Stefan: Um, have you guys seen Elena?
Bonnie: I think she went home. I'm gonna give you Elena's cell number and her email. She is big on texting, and you can tell her...I said so.
Stefan: Thank you.
[Bonnie touches Stefan's hand and has a vision.]

Stefan: You ok?
Bonnie: What happened to you? That's so rude. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Caroline: Yeah, she kind of wigs out. It's like her thing.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena goes into Jeremy's room. Jenna is searching his room.]

Elena: Jer?
Jenna: No, it's me, the hypocrite patrol.
Elena: What are you doing?
Jenna: I've become my worst nightmare. The authority figure who has to violate a 15-year-old's privacy. Jackpot. I see the hiding places haven't gotten any more creative.
Elena: What brought this on?
Jenna: Your ass-hat of a history teacher shamed me good yesterday.
Elena: You got tannered. Been there.
Jenna: Discover the impossible, Ms. Sommers. Got it. Thanks. Like I didn't know I was screwing up.
Elena: You're not screwing up, Aunt Jenna.
Jenna: Yes, I am. You know why? Because I'm not her. She made everything look so easy. You know, high school, marriage, having you. I can't do it. I'm gonna say or do the wrong thing, and he's gonna get worse, and it's gonna be my fault. It's impossible.
Elena: This is just the fear talking. You're a little scared, that's all. We all are. I have to go do something. But are you going to be ok?
Mystic Grill
[Jeremy enters. He sees Vicki and smiles. Tyler walks up to her and they start kissing. Jeremy leaves with a sad look on his face.]

[Caroline is walking to her car. She hears something and stops. She gets to her car, drops her keys, and stands up. Damon is in front of her.]

Caroline: Oh...whoa.
Damon: Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
Caroline: No, it's fine. Um...I was hoping I'd see you again.
Damon: I know.
Caroline: Cocky much?
Damon: Very much.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena rings the bell. Stefan answers it.]

Stefan: Hi.
Elena: Hey.
Stefan: Would you like to come in?
Elena: The comet's actually this way.
[Elena goes out. Stefan follows her.]

Elena: Sorry for barging in. Especially after earlier.
Stefan: No, no. I'm glad you're here. The way we left things...I didn't like it.
Elena: See, the thing is, I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do, write in my diary, like I have been since my mom gave me one when I was 10. It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling. It all goes in this little book that I hide on the second shelf behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid. But then I realized that I'd just be writing things that I should probably be telling you.
Stefan: What would you write?
Elena: I would write...Dear diary, today I convinced myself it was ok to give up. Don't take risks. Stick with the status quo. No drama, now is just not the time. But my reasons aren't reasons, they're excuses. All I'm doing is hiding from the truth, and the truth is that... I'm scared, Stefan. I'm scared that if I let myself be happy for even one moment that...the world's just going to come crashing down, and I...don't know if I can survive that.
Stefan: Do you want to know what I would write? I met a girl. We talked. It was epic. But then the sun came up and reality set in. Well, this is reality. Right here.
[They kiss.]

Forbes Residence
[Damon is kissing Caroline's stomach. All of a sudden, his face transforms and he bites her.]

Caroline: Aah!

Forbes Residence
[Caroline wakes up. Her pillow is covered with blood. Damon is sleeping next to her in bed. She gets up and tries to leave the room, but Damon wakes up too.]

Damon: Good morning.
Caroline: Please...Don't!
Damon: Don't do that. Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[She hits Damon with a lamp.]

Caroline: No! No! No! Get away from me! No!
[Caroline throws the pillow covered in blood at Damon.]

Damon: This could have gone a completely different way.
[Damon smells the pillow, his face begins to change. He attacks Caroline again.]

Caroline: Aaah!!!!!!

Mystic Falls High
Bonnie: I'm not saying don't date the guy. I'm just saying take it slow.
Elena: You were the one who said to go for it.
Bonnie: Now I'm saying take it slow.
Elena: Why the about-face?
Bonnie: It's not an about-face. You're single for the first time in your entire high school career. It's the perfect time to play the field.
Elena: Oh, because I'm so that girl. Seriously, what are you not saying?
Bonnie: It's stupid.
Elena: Bonnie...
Bonnie: What?
Elena: Spit it out.
Bonnie: I accidentally touched Stefan. And I got a really bad feeling.
Elena: Is that it? Bonnie.
Bonnie: It was bad bad!
Elena: Is this the whole witch mojo thing again?
Bonnie: You know what? I'm just concerned. This is me expressing concern about my best friend's new boyfriend.
Elena: And I love you for it, I do. But I feel good. It's been a hard year, and I'm starting to kind of feel like things are getting back to normal again. And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that.
[Behind the school.]

Vicki: I rock. I scored 2 tickets to the Posers Saturday night. They're playing at the Rat.
Jeremy: You and Tyler have fun.
Vicki: Don't be like that. Come on. I want you to go.
Jeremy: You're not worried everyone's going to know you're screwing the stoner geek? Oh, wait...everyone already knows.
Vicki: Yeah. But it's not like that anymore, so now we can be friends and just hang.
Jeremy: Tell me something, was it the drugs? Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs?
Vicki: Screw you.
Jeremy: No, if there's another reason, please, I'm all ears.
[Back to Elena and Bonnie. Stefan joins in.]

Stefan: Good morning, Elena. Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline. She's not answering her phone. So I'll see you guys later.
[Bonnie leaves.]

Elena: Bonnie, wait...
Stefan: She doesn't like me very much.
Elena: She doesn't know you. She's my best friend. She's just looking out for me. But when she does, she will love you.
[Matt and Tyler are throwing a football around.]

Tyler: Look...there's Elena and her new boyfriend. Now, what are they doing? Oh, they're walking, walking, walking. Yep. Right into the sunset.
Matt: You're a dick.
Tyler: While you just stand there looking like one of those little yard trolls.
Matt: Gnomes.
Elena: Here's what we're going to do. Are you free tonight?
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: Perfect. Dinner, my house. 8:00. You, me, and Bonnie. You two will spend some quality time and she'll get to see what a great guy you are. Mission accomplished.
Matt: Hey, what am I supposed to do, Ty? She made her choice.
Tyler: Let her know she made the wrong one.
[Tyler catches the football.]

Matt: What are you doing? Ty, don't. Ty, don't! Ty!
[Tyler throws the ball at Stefan, who has his back towards him. He quickly turns around, catches the ball, and throws it back to Tyler. Tyler and Matt are shocked. Elena laughs.]

[Inside the school.]

Elena: That throw was insane. I didn't know you played football.
Stefan: I used to. It was a long time ago.
Elena: So why don't you try out for the team?
Stefan: Yeah, I don't think so.
Elena: So you don't like football?
Stefan: No, I love football. I think it's a great sport. But in this case, I don't think football likes me. You saw Tyler over there, and we both know how Matt feels.
Elena: They don't know you. To them, you're mysterious loner guy. Wouldn't hurt to be part of. Make some friends.
Stefan: Says the girl who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.
Elena: Hey, come on. There's more to me than just gloomy graveyard girl. There's a whole other Elena that you have yet to meet. She was into everything, very busy.
Stefan: Well, I look forward to meeting her. And when will that be?
Elena: Soon. She's working on it.
[In history class. Bonnie is writing numbers on her book. 8, 14, 22.]

Tanner: World war II ended in...Anyone got anything? Miss Juan? 1945.
Elena: Psst. FYI...Our team sucks. They could use you.
Stefan: Can't.
Tanner: Pearl Harbor.
Stefan: I'm a loner.
Tanner: Miss Gilbert?
Elena: Hmm?
Tanner: Pearl Harbor?
Elena: Um...
Stefan: December 7, 1941.
Tanner: Thank you, Miss Gilbert.
Stefan: Anytime.
Tanner: Very well. The fall of the Berlin wall.
Stefan: 1989. I'm good with dates, sir.
Tanner: Are you? How good? Keep it to the year. Civil Rights Act.
Stefan: 1964.
Tanner: John F. Kennedy assassination.
Stefan: 1963.
Tanner: Martin Luther King.
Stefan: '68.
Tanner: Lincoln.
Stefan: 1865.
Tanner: Roe vs. Wade.
Stefan: 1973.
Tanner: Brown vs. Board.
Stefan: 1954.
Tanner: The battle of Gettysburg.
Stefan: 1863.
Tanner: Korean war.
Stefan: 1950 to 1953.
Tanner: Ha! It ended in '52.
Stefan: Uh, actually, sir, it was '53.
Tanner: Look it up, somebody. Quickly.
Student: It was 19...53.
[In the hallway.]

Elena: How did you know all of that?
Stefan: Years and years of crossword puzzles. It's a loner thing.
[Football field. The team is practicing.]

Matt: Nice job! Nice job!
Tanner: Mr. Lockwood, is there anything you're good at? 'Cause it isn't history, and it sure as hell isn't defending the ball!
Tyler: Yes, coach.
Tanner: Now do it again!
[Stefan is sitting in the bleachers, watching the football team practice. The cheerleaders are on the other side of the field warming up. Elena shows up.]

Bonnie: Oh, my God! You're here!
Elena: Yep. I can't be sad girl forever. The only way to get things back to the way they were are to do things that were. Oh, and you're coming to dinner tonight.
Bonnie: I am?
Elena: Mm-hmm. You, me and Stefan. You have to give him a chance.
Bonnie: Tonight's no good. Have you seen Caroline? I texted her like a hundred times.
Elena: Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett! You're going to be there.
Bonnie: Fine. I'll go.
Elena: Good.
[Stefan is talking to Mr. Tanner about joining the football team.]

Tanner: Varsity trials were last spring, Mr. Salvatore.
Stefan: I wasn't here then, sir.
Tanner: And you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned.
Stefan: Mr. Tanner, I realize that you and I didn't get off to the best start, and I want to apologize for that. I've played football before. Wide receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good.
Tanner: Well, I won't be asking you who won the super bowl in '71.
Stefan: '71 was the...Sorry. I...I understand that, sir.
Tanner: Just to see you get knocked on your ass. Borrow some gear. Go! Before I change my mind. Let's run it again!
Matt: First my girlfriend, now my team?
Tyler: Dude, this is an opportunity. Football's a contact sport. Sometimes people get hurt. Whoo! Ha ha!
[At the cheerleader's practice.]

Bonnie: Seriously, where is Caroline?
Elena: I don't know. It's not like her.
Bonnie: I'll try her again.
[Caroline arrives in Damon's car. She kisses him.]

Elena: Uh...
Bonnie: Oh, my God. That must be the mystery guy from the grill.
Elena: That's not a mystery guy. That's Damon Salvatore.
Bonnie: Salvatore, as in Stefan?!
Caroline: I got the other brother. Hope you don't mind. Sorry I'm late, girls. I, uh, was busy. All right, let's start with the double pike herkey hurdler, what do you say? And 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today? Ok? Keep going! Ok. Do it again from the top. And 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[The football field.]

Matt: Blue 80! Blue 80! Set, hut! Go! Come on, Tyler, cover it! Let's do it.
Tanner: Get it.
Matt: Line up!
[Stefan keeps doing a great job on the football field. Elena watches him.]

Matt: I hate to say it, but he's got skills.
Tyler: I think he needs a buddy pass.
Matt: Really?
Tyler: You don't get to walk on the field and act like you own the place after 5 minutes. Just hang one up there and I'll take care of the rest.
[Stefan listens in to their conversation.]

Tanner: Do it again.
Matt: All right, let's huddle up. Set, hut!
[Tyler throws the ball and hits Stefan hard with it.]

Tyler: Oh! Whoo! Welcome to the team, buddy.
Tanner: You gonna live, Salvatore?
Stefan: Yeah.
Tanner: Walk it off, son.
Matt: Hey. That was my bad.
Stefan: It's all right.
Matt: Yeah.
Tanner: All right.
[Stefan's finger is broken. He pops it back into place.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan enters his bedroom, Damon is there, reading Stefan's diary.]

Damon: How were tryouts? Did you make the team? Very Emerson, the way you reveal your soul with so many...adjectives.
[Stefan rips the diary out of his hands.]

Stefan: What are you doing here?
Damon: I've come to apologize. I've been doing some thinking, some soul searching, and...I want us to start over. We need to put the past behind us. You're my little brother, and if you want to live a normal, happy human life, then I want that for you. Maybe I can do it, too. That I can learn to be a non-living living person. Maybe there's hope for both of us.
[Damon tries to keep a straight face but can't do it.]

Stefan: You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon.
Damon: Of course it doesn't. I saw Elena today, BTW. That means by the way. She was at cheerleading practice. She looked so perky in her little short shorts. Just...simmer down, I didn't even go near her. I've got my own cheerleader now. Ooh, that reminds me...I gotta run. I have a date. Sweaty palms. Wish me luck.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena and Bonnie are preparing dinner in the kitchen.]

Bonnie: You explain it. Last night, I'm watching Nine-o, a commercial breaks come on and I'm like, I bet it's that phone commercial. And sure enough, it's that guy and the girl with the bench, he flies to Paris and he flies back. They take a picture.
Elena: Oh, come on. That commercial's on a constant loop.
Bonnie: Fine. Well, how about this? Today I'm obsessed with numbers. 3 numbers. I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22. How weird is that?
Elena: Maybe we should play the lottery. Have you talked to your Grams?
Bonnie: She's just gonna say it's because I'm a witch. I don't want to be a witch. Do you want to be a witch?
Elena: I don't want to be a witch.
[Elena pours the to-go food into a bowl.]

Bonnie: And putting it in a nice bowl isn't fooling anybody.
Elena: Ok, serving spoons. Where are the serving spoons?
Bonnie: Middle drawer on your left.
Elena: Ok, so you've been in this kitchen like a thousand times.
Bonnie: Yeah, that's it.
[The doorbell rings.]

Elena: Ok, he's here. Don't be nervous. Just be your normal loving self.
[Elena leaves.]

Bonnie: Birthday candles.
[She opens the drawer and birthday candles are there.]

[The Dining Room.]

[Elena, Stefan, and Bonnie are eating together.]

Elena: Did Tanner give you a hard time today?
Stefan: Well, he let me on the team, so I must have done something right.
Elena: Bonnie, you should have seen Stefan today. Tyler threw a ball right at him, and...
Bonnie: Yeah, I heard.
Elena: Why don't you tell Stefan about your family?
Bonnie: Um, divorced. No mom. Live with my dad.
Elena: No, about the witches. Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches. It's really cool.
Bonnie: Cool isn't the word I'd use.
Stefan: Well, it's certainly interesting. I'm not too versed, but I do know that there's a history of Celtic druids that migrated here in the 1800s.
Bonnie: My family came by way of Salem.
Stefan: Really? Salem witches?
Bonnie: Yeah.
Stefan: I would say that's pretty cool.
Bonnie: Really? Why?
Stefan: Salem witches are heroic examples of individualism and nonconformity.
Bonnie: Yeah, they are.
[The doorbell rings again.]

Elena: I wonder who that could be.
[Elena opens the door. Caroline and Damon are outside.]

Caroline: Surprise! Bonnie said you were doing dinner, so we brought dessert.
Elena: Oh.
Damon: Hope you don't mind.
Stefan: What are you doing here?
Damon: Waiting for Elena to invite me in.
Elena: Oh, yeah, you can...
Stefan: No, no, no. He can't, uh...he can't stay. Can you, Damon?
Caroline: Get in here.
Stefan: We're just...finishing up.
Elena: It's fine. Just come on in.
Damon: You have a beautiful home, Elena.
Elena: Thank you.
[The Living Room.]

Caroline: I cannot believe that Mr. Tanner let you on the team. Tyler must be seething. But good for you. Go for it.
Damon: That's what I always tell him. You have to engage. You can't just sit there and wait for life to come to you. You have to go get it.
Caroline: Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today. It's only because you missed summer camp. God, I don't know how you're ever going to learn the routines.
Bonnie: I'll work with her. She'll get it.
Caroline: I guess we can put her in the back.
Damon: You know, you don't seem like the cheerleader type, Elena.
Caroline: Oh, it's just 'cause her parents died. Yeah, I mean, she's just totally going through a blah phase. She used to be way more fun. And I say that with complete sensitivity.
Damon: I'm sorry, Elena. I know what it's like to lose both your parents. In fact, Stefan and I have watched almost every single person we've ever cared about die.
Stefan: We don't need to get into that right now, Damon.
Damon: Oh, you know what, you're right, Stef. I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up. Mmm.
Mystic Grill
[Tyler grabs Vicki.]

Vicki: Don't do that. Not while I'm working. I'll see you later.
Tyler: I'll see you later.
Matt: She's my sister and I love her, but sometimes she can really make you work for it.
Jeremy: I find it pretty easy.
[Tyler runs into Jeremy.]

Jeremy: All right, I get it. Hit me to impress her. That's...That's real nice.
Tyler: I don't need to impress her. I already won. Now you're dead.
Jeremy: Am I? 'Cause it seems like I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.
Matt: Ty, don't!
Tyler: The next time I see you, Gilbert...
Jeremy: No, next time I see you.
Matt: What are you doin', Vick?
Gilbert Residence
[The kitchen.]

Damon: One more.
Elena: Oh, thank you.
[Damon hands Elena a glass, but drops it and quickly catches it.]

Elena: Nice save.
Damon: I like you. You know how to laugh. And you make Stefan smile, which is something I haven't seen in a very long time.
Elena: Earlier, did you mean...Katherine?
Damon: Mm-hmm.
Elena: How did she die?
Damon: In a fire. Tragic fire.
Elena: Recently?
Damon: It seems like it was yesterday.
Elena: What was she like?
Damon: She was beautiful. A lot like you in that department. She was also very complicated and selfish and at times not very kind, but very sexy and seductive.
Elena: So which one of you dated her first?
Damon: Nicely deduced. Ask Stefan. I'm sure his answer differs from mine. I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.
Elena: Why do you say that?
Damon: Oh, I saw you at practice. You looked miserable.
Elena: You saw that?
Damon: Am I wrong?
Elena: I used to love it. It was fun. Things are different this year. Everything that used to matter doesn't anymore.
Damon: So don't let it. Quit, move on. Problem solved. Ta-da.
Elena: Some things could matter again.
Damon: Maybe. But...seems a little unrealistic to me.
Elena: I'm sorry. About Katherine. You lost her, too.
Bonnie: Hey. Need some help?
Damon: Sure, why not?
[Elena's living room.]

Caroline: Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time. You have to understand that they were each other's first. You know, like, from the sandbox.
Stefan: That's a really nice scarf.
Caroline: Mm. Thank you, it's new.
Stefan: Can I see it? I mean, would you mind taking it off?
Caroline: Oh, I can't.
Stefan: Why not? You ok?
Caroline: Um...All I know is that I can't take it off.
Damon: What are you two kids talking about?
Stefan: I was just commenting on her scarf.
Damon: Hmm. Hey, you know, um, Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes. Why don't you go see if you can help?
Caroline: Does it look like I do dishes?
Damon: For me?
Caroline: Hmm...I don't think so.
Damon: [Damon compels her.] Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.
Caroline: You know what? I'm gonna go see if Elena needs some help in the kitchen.
Damon: Great.
[Caroline leaves.]

Stefan: They are people, Damon. She's not a puppet. She doesn't exist for your amusement, for you to feed on whenever you want to.
Damon: Sure she does. They all do. They're whatever I want them to be. They're mine for the taking.
Stefan: All right, you've had your fun. You used Caroline, you got to meet Elena, good for you. Now it's time for you to go.
Damon: That's not a problem. Because...I've been invited in, and I'll come back tomorrow night and the following night and I'll do with your little cheerleader whatever I want to do. Because that is what is normal to me.
[Elena's bedroom.]

Elena: Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.
Stefan: Hmm. That makes one of us.
Elena: Come on. Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be...
[Stefan puts his finger to Elena's lips then touches her cheek before he kisses her. Stefan drops Elena's text book on the floor to get it out of the way so he can get closer to Elena's body she pushes him on the bed and straddles him Stefan has a hard time trying to get the bear off the bed. Elena removes her shirt by sitting up once she does Stefan slides his hand up her body. When he removes his shirt, he turns into Damon. Elena screams. She wakes up, it was a nightmare. There's a crow at the window.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan's bedroom. He is writing in his diary.]

Stefan: There must be a shred of humanity left inside my brother. Somewhere. I keep hoping. But how do I make him see it? And how do I protect her?
[Stefan opens a box and pulls out a necklace.]

Outside Mystic Falls High School
[The football game.]

Elena: Ooh. Look at you. You look hot in your jersey.
Stefan: What happened? No more cheerleader?
Elena: I quit. I'm a quitter.
Stefan: No, hey, you're not a quitter. You suffered a great loss. You're not the same person. You should be looking ahead. You should be starting over. Ok? I hope you don't think this is too soon or too weird, but...I, uh, I wanted you to have this.
[He opens up a box with the necklace. Elena takes it out.]

Elena: Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
Stefan: It's something that I've had forever, and, uh, I've never wanted to give it to anyone until now. I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me, for...good luck.
Elena: Is that rose that I smell?
Stefan: No, it's, uh...it's an herb. It's nice, huh?
Elena: I love it.
[Stefan helps Elena put on the necklace.]

Stefan: And, uh, I wanted to thank you for pushing me to try out for the team. It feels really good.
Elena: We're a pair. I quit, you start.
Stefan: Right. We're a work in progress. We'll figure it out.
[Elena kisses him.]

Caroline: And you're not in uniform because...
[It's night now. People are tailgating and cheering for the team.]

Tanner: Wait, wait, wait, Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Let's be honest here. In the past, we used to let other teams come into our town and roll right over us! [Boos from the crowd.] But that is about to change. [Cheering.] We've got some great new talent tonight starting on the offense, and I'm gonna tell you right now, it has been a long time since I have seen a kid like this with hands like these. Let's give it up for Stefan Salvatore!
Tyler: This blows. He can't start the guy. He just got here.
Tanner: That have been waiting for us to put a check in the win column, I have only one thing to say to you...Your Timberwolves are hungry.
[Tyler walks up to Vicki.]

Vicki: Hey, babe. What's wrong?
Tyler: Nothing.
Tanner: And the central high lions are what's for dinner!
Tyler: Is that Jeremy?
Vicki: Wait, no! Ty! No. Leave him alone.
Tyler: Oh, what do you care? Don't look so down. You can have her when I'm done.
[Jeremy strikes him. The two boys begin to fight.]

Vicki: Tyler, stop it! Tyler! Tyler, stop! Stop it! Stop, you're hurting him! Tyler! Tyler, stop! Tyler! Stop it! Tyler, stop!
[Stefan grabs Tyler's wrist.]

Stefan: Hey, he's down! Enough!
[Tyler punches Stefan, but sees that it has no effect on Stefan. He looks scared.]

[Jeremy grabs a broken glass bottle and strikes at Tyler, who moves out of the way and he cuts Stefan's hand instead.]

Elena: Jeremy, no!
Matt: Tyler, knock it off! Stop!
[Stefan's hand is bleeding]

Elena: What the hell, Jeremy? Put your head up, you're bleeding.
Jeremy: I'm fine!
Elena: Yeah, you smell fine.
Jeremy: Just stop, ok?
Matt: Come on, man. Come on.
Elena: Oh, my God, your hand.
[Stefan closes his palm and puts his hand behind his back.]

Stefan: No, no, no, it's fine.
Elena: Is it deep? How bad is it? Come on!
[Elena grabs his hand and opens his palm, but she sees the scar is completely gone.]

Elena: But...I saw it, it was...
Stefan: He missed. It's not my blood. See? I'm fine.
Elena: No, no, no. I...I saw it. The glass cut your hand. It was...
Stefan: It's ok. I'm ok. It's almost kick-off time, all right? So, um, I'll, uh, I'll see you after the game.
[Out on the Football field.]

Caroline: Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly. Can you stand straight, please? Could someone please help Tiki?
Bonnie: Hey! Where you been?
Elena: Can I ask you a question and you give me a really serious no-joke response?
Bonnie: Of course. What is it?
Elena: The bad mojo. When you touched Stefan and you had that reaction...
Bonnie: You know what, forget I said that. Your little dinner party plot totally won me over.
Elena: No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it? Did you see something, Or...
Bonnie: It wasn't clear like a picture. Like today, I keep seeing those same numbers I told you about...8, 14, 22.
Elena: Yeah?
Bonnie: When I touched Stefan, it was a feeling. And it vibrated through me, and it was cold, and it...
Elena: And what?
Bonnie: It was death. It's what I imagine death to be like.
[Elena goes to her car.]

Elena: You scared me. What are you doing here?
Damon: I'm hiding from Caroline.
Elena: And why is that?
Damon: I needed a break. She talks more than I can listen.
Elena: That could be a sign.
Damon: Well, she's awfully young.
Elena: Not much younger than you are.
Damon: I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture. I think she'd drive me crazy.
Elena: Caroline does have some really annoying traits, but we've been friends since the first grade and that means something to me.
Damon: Duly noted. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable. That's not my intention.
Elena: Yes, it is. Otherwise you wouldn't put an alternate meaning behind everything you say.
Damon: You're right. I do have other intentions, but so do you.
Elena: Really?
Damon: Mm-hmm. I see 'em. You want me.
Elena: Excuse me?
Damon: I get to you. You find yourself drawn to me. You think about me even when you don't want to think about me. I bet you even dreamed about me. And right now...You want to kiss me.
[She strikes him.]

Elena: What the hell? I don't know what game you're trying to play with Stefan here, but I don't want to be part of it. And I don't know what happened in the past, but let's get one thing straight...I am not Katherine.
[Later.]

Matt: You gonna be able to play?
Stefan: Oh, yeah, I'm good.
Matt: Uh, what you did back there...you had Jeremy's back.
Stefan: Ah, he's a messed-up kid. Somebody's gotta look out for him.
Matt: I know. This week at practice I was a dick.
Stefan: Had your reasons.
Matt: No excuse. [Matt holds out his hand, Stefan shakes it.] Good luck tonight. We're lucky to have you.
[Damon is in the corner. He claps for Stefan.]

Damon: Isn't that nice? Stefan joins a team, makes a friend. It's all so, rah, rah, go team, yeah!
Stefan: Not tonight. I'm done with you.
Damon: Nice trick with Elena. Let me guess...vervain in the necklace? I admit, I was a bit surprised. It's been a while since anyone could resist my compulsion. Where'd you get it?
Stefan: Does it matter?
Damon: Guess I could just seduce her the old-fashioned way. Or I could just...eat her.
Stefan: No. You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.
Damon: No?
Stefan: Because deep down inside, there is a part of you that feels for her. I was worried that you had no humanity left inside of you, that you may have actually become the monster that you pretend to be.
Damon: Who's pretending?
Stefan: Then kill me.
Damon: Well, I'm...I'm tempted.
Stefan: No, you're not. You've had lifetimes to do it, and yet, here I am. I'm still alive. And there you are. You're still haunting me. After 145 years. Katherine is dead. And you hate me because you loved her, and you torture me because you still do. And that, my brother, is your humanity.
Tanner: Salvatore! What the hell? We've got a game to play!
Damon: If that's my humanity...then what's this?
[Damon kills Tanner.]

Tanner: Aah!
Stefan: No!
Damon: Anyone, anytime, any place.
[The locker room.]

Tyler: Tanner's M.I.A. I think he had a little bit too much beer.
Matt: Don't talk to me right now, all right? I'm pissed at you.
Tyler: What's your problem?
Matt: What's my...You're my problem, all right? You're a bully. A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man. And I'm sick of it. I mean, what was that about tonight? What's beating up the new guy going to prove? Or screwing with my sister or pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother.
Tyler: Girlfriend? Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but she dumped your ass. Are you for real?! You want to hit me? I'm on your team.
Matt: This was over the line. Even for you.
[Matt discovers Tanner's body.]

Matt: Somebody help!
[The police arrived. Bonnie looks at the scene. She looks at the license plate BLDG 8, the immatriculation's car is FHT 14 and on the ground, the number 22. Bonnie is afraid.]

[The football field. Jeremy is sitting by the bleachers. Vicki comes up to him.]

Vicki: It wasn't just for the drugs.
[In the parking lot.]

Elena: What kind of animal could be doing all this? Why would it come out of the woods and attack someone in the middle of town?
Stefan: I don't know. I don't know.
Elena: I was so sure that you cut your hand. I saw it.
Stefan: I'm fine. I'm fine, ok? We're fine. That's what matters.
[They embrace.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan's bedroom. He's writing in his diary.]

Stefan: I thought there was hope that somewhere deep inside, something in Damon was still human, normal. But I was wrong. There's nothing human left in Damon. No good, no kindness. No love. Only a monster Who must be stopped.
Gilbert Residence
[Damon is in Elena's bedroom. Elena is sleeping. Damon gently caresses her face. Elena wakes up, puts her diary on the bedside table and turns off the lamp. Damon is gone.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena wakes up. She hears a noise. She gets out of bed.]

Elena: Hello? Jeremy? Hello?
[Elena tries to turn on the light, but the power is out.]

Logan [on TV]: This is Logan Fell coming to you live from the streets of Mystic Falls with breaking news of another deadly animal attack. The wild animal terrorizing the citizens of Mystic Falls has claimed another victim, local high school student Elena Gilbert. Police are certain that forensic evidence will confirm that this is the same animal responsible for recent attacks.
Damon: You know what's coming next.
[Elena runs. She opens the front door, sees Damon, and slams it shut. She slowly walks towards the stairs, but Damon grabs her and bites her neck.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan wakes up in his bedroom.]

Stefan: Ahh!
Damon: Bad dream? Do you know how easy it was to get into your head just now? You really need some human blood. It might even the playing field. Football reference. Too soon.
[Stefan throws a knife at Damon, hitting him in the stomach. Damon pulls it out.]

Damon: All right, I deserved that. But I just wanted to let you know, they caught the culprit. The animal responsible for killing coach Tanner and all those people.
Stefan: What are you talking about?
Damon: It was a mountain lion. Really big one. It attacked a hunter this morning. It's all over the news. Deadly beast captured. All's well in Mystic Falls.
Stefan: Why would you cover your tracks?
Damon: I've decided to stay a while. And I'm just having way too much fun here with you and Elena.
Stefan: Can't touch her now.
Damon: Well, the vervain keeps me out of her head. Maybe that's not my target. Believe it or not, Stefan, some girls don't need my persuasion. Some girls just can't resist my good looks, my style and my charm and my unflinching ability to listen to Taylor Swift.
[Damon stabs Stefan in the stomach. It clearly hurts Stefan more than it did Damon, for Stefan falls to the floor.]

Damon: This is John Varvatos, dude. Dick move.
[Stefan removes the knife.]

[Stefan is writing in his diary.]

Sheriff Forbes [on TV]: I can confirm that a 12-foot puma mountain lion attacked a hunter and was subsequently shot and killed. The hunter is in stable condition.
Stefan: The real animal is still out there, waiting for me, challenging me to fight back, to stop him. But how do I stop a monster without becoming one myself?
Gilbert Residence
Logan [on TV]: To repeat, the animal terrorizing Mystic Falls has been caught.
Jenna: Scum ball. Scum bucket.
Elena: Who are you talking to?
Jenna: Him.
Elena: The news guy?
Jenna: Also known as Logan Scum Fell. Did your mom ever tell you why I moved away from Mystic Falls?
Elena: Oh, no way. You and him? He's cute.
Jenna: He is not cute. There's nothing cute about him. What are you doing with that?
Elena: I went yesterday and got it from the safe deposit box. Mom had told Mrs. Lockwood she would loan it to the founder's council for their heritage display.
Jenna: Is that grandma Beth's wedding ring?
Elena: Originally it was great-great-grandma Mary's wedding ring.
Jeremy: How much do you think this stuff is worth? You know, like on eBay?
Elena: You're not gonna find out.
Jeremy: That stuff is mom and dad's. You can't just give it away.
Elena: I'm not giving it away. It's called a loan, Jeremy.
[Doorbell rings.]

Stefan: Hi.
[Elena drags him in the house and kisses him passionately.]

Elena: Hi.
[In Elena's bedroom.]

[Stefan and Elena are making out. Stefan is kissing Elena's neck when he looks in her mirror and sees his face has transformed. He sits up.]

Elena: Are you okay?
Stefan: I'm good. Sorry.
Elena: Maybe we should press pause.
Stefan: Yeah, you're probably right. That was getting a bit...
Elena: Yeah.
Stefan: Yeah.
Elena: How do you look in a suit?
Stefan: I can pull one off.
Elena: How about tomorrow night? Will you be my date to the Founder's Party?
Stefan: They still do that?
Elena: Have you been before?
Stefan: No, the Salvatores don't get invited anymore.
Elena: Well, this year, there's this heritage project that meant a lot to my mom. She was really involved in the founder's council, and it was her favorite party. I know it sounds really boring, but, 
Stefan: I would be honored to accompany you, Miss Gilbert.
Elena: The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Salvatore.
Forbes Residence
[Caroline's bedroom. Caroline is trying on dresses for the Founder's Party.]

Damon: No yellow. Jaundice. Go for the blue.
Caroline: I don't like the blue.
Damon: Well, I do. And if I'm gonna be your date, 
Caroline: You cannot be my date. My mother is going to be there, and she is a very proud gun owner.
Damon: I went through a lot of trouble to make sure this party wasn't cancelled. It's very important I be there. Please take me.
Caroline: You should come to the founder's party with me.
Damon: Not if you're wearing that dress. What's so special about this Bella girl? Edward's so whipped.
Caroline: You gotta read the first book first. It won't make sense if you don't.
Damon: Ah, I miss Anne Rice. She was so on it.
Caroline: How come you don't sparkle?
Damon: Because I live in the real world, where vampires burn in the sun.
Caroline: Yeah, but you go in the sun.
Damon: I have a ring. It protects me. Long story.
Caroline: Will these bites turn me into a vampire?
Damon: It's more complicated than that. You'd have to feed on my blood, then die, then feed on a human's,it's a whole ordeal. This book, by the way has it all wrong.
[Damon kisses Caroline on the neck.]

Caroline: You can be very sweet when you want to be.
Damon: Yes, I can be sweet.
Caroline: Are you going to kill me?
Damon: Mm-hmm. But not yet.
Caroline: Why not?
Damon: Because there's something I need you to do for me.
Caroline: Anything.
Damon: How good are you at getting this little nose where it doesn't belong?
Caroline: Oh, I'm excellent.
Damon: Mmm.
Mystic Grill
[Tyler is eating with his parents.]

Mr Lockwood: So what happens with the season? One big forfeit? Are they looking for a new coach?
Tyler: I don't know, dad. I doubt anybody's thinking about that right now.
Mrs Lockwood: Charles, founder's party, focus.
Vicki: How are y'all doing over here?
Mr Lockwood: Ah, we're doing great, sweetheart.
Vicki: Is there anything else I can get you?
Tyler: We're fine, thanks.
Mr Lockwood: Just the check, honey.
Vicki: Here you go, Mayor Lockwood.
Mr Lockwood: Thanks.
[Caroline arrives with Bonnie.]

Bonnie: You're taking Damon to the founder's party? What about me?
Caroline: Go with Elena.
Bonnie: She's asking Stefan.
Caroline: Okay, go by yourself.
Bonnie: Gee, thanks. What about your mom? Is she okay with you bringing Damon?
Caroline: And I'm supposed to care why?
Bonnie: He's older sexy danger guy.
Caroline: Older sexy danger guy? Is that an official witch twitter tweet?
Bonnie: No more witch jokes, okay? That whole Mr. Tanner prediction thing has me freaked.
Caroline: Okay. And Damon's not dangerous. You know, he just has a lot of issues with his brother. You know, like major, deep-rooted drama.
Bonnie: Like...?
Caroline: I'm not really supposed to say anything.
Bonnie: Caroline Forbes, when have you ever kept a secret in your life?
Caroline: Okay. But you can't tell Elena.
Bonnie: No.
Tyler: So what you gonna buy me?
Vicki: Ugh, some class. Oh, your parents are gone. I guess we can be close now.
Tyler: What the hell does that mean?
Vicki: You treat me like trash. I'm sick of it.
Tyler: I don't think you're trash.
Vicki: Really? Then who are you taking to the founder's party?
Tyler: Vicki Donovan. Do you want me to ask you to the founder's party?
Vicki: No. It'll be stupid and lame.
Tyler: True. But it'll be less stupid and lame if you were there.
[Tyler leaves.]

Jeremy: You realize you had to ask him to ask you, right? You figure if you dress up like a respectable young lady, he'll finally treat you like one?
Vicki: Screw you, Jeremy.
Jeremy: You know you're making the wrong choice, yet you make it anyway. It's sad.
Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: I didn't know you were here.
Damon: Just going through Stefan's homework. Boy, this country sure has dumbed down in the last hundred years. Why he wants to go to high school is beyond me. I mean, in the seventies, he went Ivy League. Harvard, I understood. Actually, no. I didn't get that either. Go ahead, purge. Get it out. What's on your mind?
Zach: Why are you here, Damon?
Damon: To spend time with you, Zach. Family's important.
Zach: I know you. You always have a motive. So tell me, what is it this time?
[Damon gets up and grabs Zach by the throat.]

Damon: You are in no position to question me.
Zach: I didn't mean to upset you.
Damon: This is not upset, Zach.
Stefan: What's going on?
[Damon drops Zach.]

Damon: Having a family moment, Stefan. Spending some quality time.
Stefan: Hey, are you okay?
Zach: No, I'm not. And neither are you. How many more people have to die before you see that?
Stefan: I see it. All right, Zach, I see it.
Zach: Then why aren't you doing anything about it?
Stefan: I can't, Zach. I can't. It would take human blood. It's the only way that I could stop him, and I can't do that.
Zach: The vervain could weaken him if he ingested it. It would help get you the upper hand.
Stefan: Vervain hasn't grown here since 1865. Damon saw to that. The little I had, I gave to Elena. What?
[Stefan and Zach walk down in the cellar.]

Stefan: You've been growing it.
Zach: It's just something that's been passed down through the generations. Blood only runs so deep when you're related to vampires. Damon would kill me if he knew that I had it.
Stefan: But you're telling me. Why?
Zach: Because I trust you. And you're gonna need it if you want to get rid of him.
Gilbert Residence
[The doorbell rings. Jeremy answers it. He sees it's Tyler and tries to close the door but Tyler holds it open.]

Tyler: I'm here for my mom. I was supposed to pick up a box of stuff.
Elena: Right here. Please be careful.
Jeremy: Yeah, be careful with it, dick.
Elena: Hey! Not now, okay, guys? Please?
Tyler: I'm fine. He's just being a punk.
Jeremy: I got your punk.
Elena: Look, Tyler, maybe you should go. Tell your mom that I'll see her tonight.
Tyler: Hey. Would it make a difference if I told you I actually like Vicki?
Jeremy: Not even if you meant it.
[In Elena's bedroom.]

Bonnie: Delicate flower vs. naughty vixen.
Elena: Tough call. Can we mix them?
Bonnie: Look at you, getting all pretty for your date. You seem happy-ish.
Elena: I am...ish. Tonight's going to be a good night. But don't let that stop you from telling me whatever it is you wanted to tell me as soon as you walked in the door.
Bonnie: What if I tell you in the morning? I don't want to ruin the night.
Elena: Bonnie, out with it.
Bonnie: Okay, but it has to go in the vault, because Caroline will kill me if it gets back to Damon that she squealed. Apparently Stefan has a very interesting back story.
Elena: Uh-huh.
Bonnie: Do you know what happened with his ex-girlfriend Katherine?
Elena: I know that they both dated her and that's why they have issues.
Bonnie: Yeah, they both dated her, only she chose Damon. And that drove Stefan mad, so he did horrible things to try and break them up. He manipulated Katherine. He filled her head with all these lies until finally it worked, and she turned against Damon.
Elena: That sounds like one person's side of the story, meaning Damon's.
Bonnie: I just wanted you to know.
Elena: Anyway, his past relationships are none of my business.
Bonnie: Unless he's a calculating, manipulative liar. That is your business.
Elena: Stefan is none of those things.
Bonnie: Yeah? How do you know?
Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: Do they still wear ties at this thing?
Stefan: Why are you even going?
Damon: It's only fitting. We were at the very first one, remember?
Stefan: I think it's better if we don't draw attention to ourselves.
Damon: So you should stay here. I'll see to it Elena has a good time. My goodness, I've driven you to drink.
Stefan: Can't seem to rid myself of you. What else am I supposed to do, besides go about living my life?
Damon: Go about living my life. See, therein lies your eternal struggle. You're dead, dude. Get over it. What do you think?
Gilbert Residence
[Elena and Bonnie are getting pretty. Elena's phone is ringing. She answers it.]

Elena: Hello? Hi, Mrs. Lockwood. What do you mean? It is? Are you sure? 'Cause I saw it. Let me check. Mm-hmm. I will find it and bring it. Ok. Bye.
Bonnie: What's wrong?
[Elena goes into Jeremy's room. She hits him.]

Jeremy: Ahh! God, what now?
Elena: The pocket watch. Where is it?
Jeremy: What watch?
Elena: The one you stole from mom's box. Look, Mrs. Lockwood just called me, freaking out. It was on the list, Jeremy. And she can't find it, and she thinks she's the one who lost it.
Jeremy: Maybe she did. Maybe Tyler took it.
Elena: Don't even play that card. Jeremy, you took it. If I go online, am I going to find it on eBay? Is that how you pay for your pot?
Jeremy: Screw you. [Jeremy gets up and gets the pocket watch.] I would never sell this, ok?
Elena: Then why did you take it?
Jeremy: Because it's supposed to be mine. Dad said it goes to the firstborn son. His father gave it to him, and now what?
[Jeremy hands it to Elena.]

Elena: And he was going to give it to you.
Jeremy: Yeah.
Elena: Look, Jeremy, it's still yours, okay? Mom promised Mrs. Lockwood. What do you want me to do?
Jeremy: Just take it and get out.
Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: It's cool not growing old. I like being the eternal stud.
Stefan: Yes, being a 150-year-old teenager has been the height of my happiness.
Damon: You cracked a funny, Stefan. I should have a drink to celebrate. 1864. You and Katherine were the perfect couple. It was hell watching you dance with her.
Stefan: My happiness was short-lived, as you well know.
Damon: I remember. I left the party early, I was waiting for her. The night you dropped her off, I was waiting just inside. You were such a gentleman, gave her a kiss on the cheek. And what she really wanted was...Oh, well. Here's to history repeating itself, huh?
[ He smells the drink and discovers it's spiked with vervain. He dumps the drink on the floor.]

Damon: I admire your effort, Stefan. Pouring yourself a drink then spiking the bottle with vervain. I'm not some drunk sorority chick. You can't roofie me. But I can't help but feel a little used. I thought we were having a moment. I have to go to the party angry. Who knows what I'll do?
Lockwood Residence
[The Founder's Party.]

Tyler: Uh, let's go this way.
Vicki: Why?
Tyler: Line's too long. We can go around back. Come on, party's in the back.
Salvatore Boarding House
Zach: That was his favorite scotch. I'm sorry, I thought it would work.
Stefan: I wasn't counting on it.
Zach: You knew it would fail?
Stefan: Did what I wanted. It lowered his guard. He won't expect me to try again so soon.
Zach: I doubled what I put in the scotch.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena is getting ready for the party. She takes the pocket watch and gives it back to Jeremy.]

Lockwood Residence
Mrs Lockwood: Caroline! You look smashing.
Caroline: Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood. This is my boyfriend Damon.
Mrs Lockwood: Oh, well, come on in.
Damon: Lovely to meet you. I've been looking forward to this party for quite a while.
Mrs Lockwood: Well, enjoy.
Damon: Let's get a drink.
Caroline: Wait here.
[Caroline goes to talk to her mother.]

Caroline: Really, you couldn't even change out of the badge for this?
Sheriff Forbes: I'm working, honey. Who's the date you just tried to sneak past me?
Caroline: Just some guy.
Sheriff Forbes: He's a little old for you, don't you think?
Caroline: Oh, 'cause otherwise you'd approve. Yeah, I doubt that.
[Elena and Stefan arrive.]

Elena: Hi, Mayor Lockwood
Mr Lockwood: Hey. Hey, guys, come on in.
Stefan: Thank you.
Sheriff Forbes: Where's your dad?
Caroline: Memphis.
Sheriff Forbes: Good.
Caroline: With Steven.
[Stefan kisses Elena on the cheek. Damon watches them, looking slightly jealous.]

[Elena is looking at her parent's wedding rings. Stefan comes up behind her.]

Stefan: Your parents?
Elena: There's a lot of history here.
[Jenna takes a glass of wine from a butler.]

Logan: Jenna.
Jenna: Hello Logan.
Logan: It's good to see you.
Jenna: I thought I might see you here.
Logan: You knew it.
Jenna: I dreaded.
Logan: But were secretly hoping.
Jenna: And now that I have...
Logan: Whoa, hey, not so fast. I know you. You have a lot more insults in you, I can tell.
Jenna: Your hairline's receding.
Logan: No, it's not. You want to have lunch?
Jenna: Nope.
Logan: You haven't changed a bit.
Jenna: Oh, yes, I have. I'm meaner now.
[Elena is reading the first registry.]

Elena: The founding families in Mystic Falls welcomes you to the inaugural founder's council celebration. Wow, look, it's the original guest registry. Look at all these familiar names, Sheriff William Forbes, Mayor Benjamin Lockwood. Is that Damon Salvatore? And, Stefan Salvatore?
Damon: The original Salvatore brothers. Our ancestors. Tragic story, actually.
Stefan: We don't need to bore them with stories of the past.
Elena: It's not boring, Stefan. I'd love to hear more about your family.
Caroline: Well, I'm bored. I want to dance. And Damon won't dance with me.
Damon: Mm-hmm.
Caroline: Could I just borrow your date?
Elena: Oh, uh...
Stefan: I don't really dance.
Damon: Oh, sure he does. You should see him. Waltz, the jitterbug, the moonwalk. He does it all.
Caroline: You wouldn't mind, would you, Elena?
Elena: It's up to Stefan.
Caroline: Well sorry, but I'm not going to take no for an answer.
[Caroline takes Stefan out to dance.]

Damon: I want to apologize to you for being such a world-class jerk the other night when I tried to kiss you. There's no excuse. My therapist says I'm...Acting out, trying to punish Stefan.
Elena: For what?
Damon: It's all in the past. I don't even want to bring it up. Let's just say that the men in the Salvatore family have been cursed with sibling rivalry. And it all started with the original Salvatore brothers.
Stefan: Damon told you to ask me to dance. Didn't he?
Caroline: Now why would he do that?
Stefan: Would you like one?
[Stefan grabs a glass of champagne for himself and Caroline.]

Stefan: Thank you.
Caroline: Okay, just tell me if you see my mom.
Damon: The Salvatore name was practically royalty in this town. Until the war. There was a battle here, 
Elena: The Battle of Willow Creek.
Damon: Right.
Elena: I know, we talked about it in class. Confederate soldiers fired on a church with civilians inside.
Damon: What the history books left out was the people that were killed. They weren't there by accident. They were believed to be union sympathizers. So some of the founders on the confederacy side back then wanted them rounded up and burned alive. Stefan and Damon had someone they loved very much in that church. And when they went to rescue them, they were shot. Murdered in cold blood.
Elena: Who was in the church that they wanted to save?
Damon: A woman, I guess. Doesn't it always come down to the love of a woman?
Elena: Look, I'm sorry that you and Stefan have this thing between you, but I can't get in the middle of it, Damon. I just...I hope you two can work it out.
Damon: I hope so, too.
[Vicki and Tyler on a bench, away from the party.]

Vicki: So you want to dance?
Tyler: Me dancing? Not pretty.
Vicki: Maybe you could show me around. I mean, this place is amazing.
Tyler: Yeah, if you like living in a museum.
Vicki: Maybe I should just strip naked and give Pastor Bill a lap dance. I mean, that's why we're hiding in a corner all night, isn't it? You're scared of how I'm going to act? You afraid of what your parents are going to think about your date from the wrong side of the tracks?
Tyler: I don't care about what they think.
Vicki: Great. Let's go say hi.
Tyler: Knock it off, Vick.
Vicki: Or we could just, you know, sneak up to your bedroom. As long as nobody sees us, right?
Tyler: Vicki, I swear...
Vicki: What's a matter, Ty? You scared to stand up to your mommy? It's pretty pathetic.
Tyler: Let go!
Mrs Lockwood: Tyler...We didn't get a chance to say hello earlier. It's Vicki, right? Matt's sister.
Vicki: Yes, ma'am.
Mrs Lockwood: You'll have to forgive my son's rudeness. He gets it from his father.
Vicki: Well, that's okay, Mrs. Lockwood. Tyler and I were just saying good night.
Mrs Lockwood: That's what you get when you bring the trash into the party.
[Bonnie is sitting at a table. A candle goes out. She looks at it and it re-ignites. Bonnie blows it out.]

[Damon and Elena go out to meet Stefan and Caroline]

Damon: What'd we miss?
Stefan: We were just chatting. Drink, Damon?
Damon: No, thanks, I'll pass.
Elena: Stefan, do you have another dance in you?
Stefan: Absolutely.
[Stefan takes Elena out to the dance floor.]

Caroline: They look so cute together.
Damon: Don't talk, please.
[In the house. At the bar.]

Logan: Don't shoot! Only need a refill.
Jenna: Shooting implies caring.
Logan: Feigned indifference. I like it.
Jenna: I'm over the banter, Logan. I'd really rather you just left me alone.
Logan: I'm sorry, Jenna. About your sister.
Jenna: Thank you.
Logan: I Came to the funeral.
Jenna: I know. I saw you.
Logan: Yeah, I didn't want to push my way in, but I wanted to be there for you. And when I heard you were staying in Mystic Falls, I thought maybe...Well, maybe I could have a second chance to make things right.
Jenna: Her name was Monica, wasn't it?
[Back on the dance floor. Stefan and Elena are still dancing.]

Stefan: I hope Damon didn't drive you too crazy.
Elena: No, actually, he was on good behavior. He even apologized and explained why he is the way he is. And it all goes back to Katherine.
Stefan: Hmm.
Elena: So tell me about her. What happened?
Stefan: It's not something I like to talk about.
Elena: I get that. I do. I just want you to know that you can. I mean, I burden you with all of my drama, and I want you to do the same.
Stefan: I know. Thank you.
Elena: The truth is, Stefan...I don't really know that much about you, and I'd really love it if you would open up to me.
[They stop dancing.]

Stefan: Damon said something, didn't he? He likes to play games and cause trouble, Elena.
Elena: This isn't about Damon, it's about me trying to get to know you. Look, you're the mystery guy, and I like that. But with mystery comes secrets, and this thing with Katherine.
Stefan: Let it go. I don't want to talk about it.
Elena: Well, then, say something about yourself. Anything. Otherwise, I'm left with nothing but what other people tell me.
Stefan: Don't you see what Damon has done here? He's trying to get you to turn against me.
Elena: Well, then I guess it's working.
[Elena walks away. Damon and Stefan look at each other.]

[Bonnie and Elena are inside, eating ice cream.]

Bonnie: This is my fault. I planted doubt. I'm a doubt planter.
Elena: It's not your fault. I just, I feel terrible because I said that I wouldn't get in the middle of it, and then that's exactly what I did. I got all snotty.
Mrs Lockwood: Elena, honey, there you are. I notice the watch still isn't in the collection.
Elena: Oh, um, I'm sorry, Mrs. Lockwood. I, um, I couldn't find it. I guess it's still packed up in my parents' stuff somewhere.
Mrs Lockwood: I see. Well, please let me know if you do find it.
Elena: OK.
[Damon walks upstairs. Caroline follows him.]

Caroline: Where have you been?
Damon: Ah. Looking for you.
Caroline: Your brother barely danced with me for five minutes, 
Damon: Okay, just a minute. Stand right...there.
[Damon starts searching through the collection.]

Caroline: Um, you're not supposed to touch. What is that?
[Damon finds what he is looking for.]

Damon: A very important crystal.
Caroline: Well, how did you know that it was there?
Damon: Because I put it there.
Caroline: When?
Damon: A long time ago. Tonight, I'm taking it back, thanks to you.
Caroline: Well, what's it for?
Damon: Never you mind.
Caroline: Well, you can't just steal it.
Damon: It's not stealing if it's mine. Come on.
Caroline: Well...
[At the bar.]

Logan: Vodka tonic. Okay, I know that this is probably going to be strike 3, but I hope you can see it for what it is.
Jenna: And what is it?
Logan: Persistence, groveling, commitment. Take your pick.
Jenna: I fled town because of you. Fled.
Logan: I was young and stupid, and then things changed. Life got...real. You'd know that better than anyone.
Jenna: Hypothetically speaking, if allowed, how would you make things right?
Logan: Well, more groveling, of course. A recap of the past few years spent soul searching. Cheese fries.
Jenna: Obvious.
Logan: I know my audience.
Jenna: Yes to lunch. Call me.
[In the living room.]

Mrs Lockwood: Look around. What's missing? The flames, the candles. Why aren't they lit? There's matches in the kitchen.
Bonnie: Bitch.
[Bonnie looks at a candle and tries to light it but turns away. She starts to leave but turns back around and sees that all the candles have lit up.]

[Elena enters the powder room. Caroline is there.]

Elena: Hey.
Caroline: Hey. So how are things with Stefan?
Elena: Great. Just great.
Caroline: Really? Well, my radar must be off, 'cause I was getting all sorts of other vibes...
[Elena looks at Caroline's neck and sees something.]

Elena: What is that?
Caroline: Hmm? [Elena tries to lift her scarf up.] Don't!
[Elena lifts her scarf up and sees a bad bite mark.]

Elena: Oh god, Caroline, what happened?
Caroline: Nothing, okay?!
Elena: That is not nothing! Did somebody hurt you?
Caroline: No, okay, nothing. It just...My mom would kill me.
[Elena pulls down her shawl and sees another bite mark on her back.]

Elena: Did Damon hurt you?
Caroline: No! Of course not! Just leave me alone. Okay, Elena?!
[Elena walks outside and sees Damon. She pushes him.]

Elena: There is something seriously wrong with you. You stay away from Caroline or I will go straight to her mother, the sheriff. You got it? Stay away from her.
[Elena walks to where Stefan is]

Elena: I'm sorry. I take it all back. You're completely right about Damon.
Stefan: What did he do?
Elena: There are bruises all over Caroline's body. Bite marks, and he has her all confused and messed up in the head. You don't look surprised.
Stefan: Um...I'm handling it.
Elena: Handling it? Stefan, you should be having him arrested.
Stefan: Elena, please. I...I don't expect you to understand.
Elena: I don't understand anything, Stefan. So why don't you just clear it up for me?
Stefan: Look, there are things that you don't know, okay? Things that I want to tell you, but I can't. And I may never be able to. And I just need you to trust me.
Elena: Trust is earned. I can't just magically hand it over.
[Stefan sees Damon dragging Caroline out into the yard.]

Stefan: I'm so sorry. I have to go.
Gilbert Residence
[Doorbell rings. Jeremy answers the door. It's Vicki.]

Jeremy: You look amazing. What are you doing here?
Vicki: I was thinking maybe I could make one more wrong choice today. I still have 17 minutes.
[Vicki kisses him.]

Lockwood Residence
[Damon is dragging Caroline out to the lawn. She turns her around to face him.]

Caroline: Don't! She took it off and I got flustered, okay?! I didn't know what to say. But I swear, okay? I did not tell her. I just told her that you didn't mean to hurt me.
[Damon goes behind Caroline and wraps his arms around her waist.]

Damon: You make me crazy, you know that? It's okay. I forgive you.
Caroline: I swear I didn't say, 
Damon: Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. Unfortunately...I am so over you now.
[He bites her. But they both fall to the ground.]

Damon: What the hell?
Stefan: You know, I couldn't spike your drink...So I spiked hers.
[Caroline wakes up on the lawn. She grabs the crystal in the lawn. Elena sees her and walks over to her.]

Elena: Caroline? There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. Are you okay?
Caroline: Yeah. I'm fine.
Elena: Caroline, what happened?
Caroline: I'm fine.
Elena: No. You're shaking. Caroline, What, 
Caroline: I'm fine!
Elena: Caroline, come here, come here.
[Caroline starts to cry and Elena hugs her.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Zach and Stefan lock Damon in the cellar.]

Stefan: I did what I had to do...To protect Elena, to protect everyone. Yes, Damon, the headline reads Deadly beast captured. All is well in Mystic Falls.
Lockwood Residence
Mr Lockwood: Thank you for staying so late.
Sheriff Forbes: Did you get the Gilbert watch?
Mrs Lockwood: She claims it's packed away in her parents' things.
Logan: I can get it.
Sheriff Forbes: Good. We're going to need it.
Mr Lockwood: Are you sure?
Sheriff Forbes: Five bodies all drained of blood? I'm certain.
Logan: They've come back.

Salvatore Boarding House
[In the cellar.]

Damon: Where is my ring?
Stefan: Won't be needing it anymore.
Damon: How long have I been here?
Stefan: Three days.
Damon: What are you doing?
Stefan: During the dark ages when a vampire's actions threatened to expose or bring harm upon the entire race, they would face judgment. They sought to reeducate them rather than to punish them.
Damon: You know what will happen if I don't...feed on blood.
Stefan: You'll grow weaker and weaker. Eventually you won't be able to move or speak. In a week your skin will desiccate, and you'll mummify. A living corpse. Unable to hurt anyone. Ever.
Damon: So what, you're just going to leave me in the basement, forever?
Stefan: I've injected you with enough vervain to keep you weak. Once your circulation stops, I'll move you to the family crypt, and then in 50 years, we can reevaluate.
Damon: I'm stronger than you think.
Stefan: You always have been. But you're not stronger than the vervain. And we both know it. I'm sorry. Didn't have to be this way.

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is waking up and goes to the bathroom. She meets Vicki.]

Vicki: I--I'm sorry, I'm almost done.
Elena: It's--it's ok. Take your time.
[Elena leaves and Vicki goes to Jeremy's room.]

Vicki: I think you might be in trouble.
Jeremy: What did you do?
Vicki: Oh, Elena saw me.
Jeremy: I'm a drug-using delinquent. A girl in bed doesn't really rank. Sorry.
[Elena finds Jenna in the kitchen.]

Elena: Jenna! Are you aware of what's going on upstairs?
Jenna: Uh-huh.
Elena: And you have no objection?
Jenna: He could be craftier about it, at least make an effort to sneak her in and out. Oh, and just so you know, I won't be home for dinner.
Elena: Oh, so you're actually going to do it. You're gonna go out with Logan.
Jenna: I'm going to show up and torture him, yes. And have you heard from Stefan?
Elena: Not since he left that very vague message three days ago. Hi, um, Elena, I, um, have something I have to do. I'll, uh, explain in a few days.
Jenna: Haven't you called him?
Elena: Nope. Not going to either.
Jenna: And you're ok with everything?
Elena: No, I'm not ok with any of it. But I'm not gonna cry about it, either. You know, I was going to write in my diary this morning and then I thought, what am I going to write? Honestly, I'm not gonna be one of those pathetic girls whose world stops spinning because of some guy.
Jenna: Ok, then.
Elena: I'll be fine.
Salvatore Boarding House
Stefan: He's awake. He's weak, but it's probably best to stay out of the basement. He's Damon. I'm not sure how dangerous he still might be.
Zach: You're going to school?
Stefan: Came here to live a life. It's about time I get back to that. And Elena, if she's still speaking to me.
Zach: Why haven't you called her?
Stefan: What am suppose to do, feed her another lie? I hate lying to her, Zach. I'm not good at it. She already thinks I'm hiding something.
Zach: What choice do you have? You came here because you wanted to live as normal a life as you could. You knew this was going to be a part of it.
Forbes Residence
[Caroline is in her bedroom with Bonnie.]

Caroline: I remember the party. Damon came up behind me, and he was kissing my neck, or biting my neck. I passed out. It's like there's holes in my memory lately. It's just weird. Maybe I let him bite me.
Bonnie: Why would you do that?
Caroline: Can we just not talk about it, ok? Don't want to talk about Damon. I don't want to talk about any of it. Just want to go back to normal. What are you doing with that candle?
Bonnie: Um...nothing. What's this?
[Bonnie sees the crystal.]

Caroline: Damon gave it to me. Or he was going to give it to me. All I know is, it's mine now.
Bonnie: It's ugly.
Caroline: Well, get your grubby hands off it.
Mystic Falls High School
Caroline: The sexy suds car wash is tomorrow. The football team and the band have committed. Well, not all the band. Just the ones who could pull off the bikini. I want, in your face, sexy. I mean, it's a fund raiser, for god's sake.
Elena: Unbelievable. It's like nothing happened.
Bonnie: She's in denial.
Stefan: Hey.
Bonnie: Hey. You know, I gotta go. Be somewhere right now.
Stefan: I'm so sorry I haven't called.
Elena: No worries. I'll live.
Stefan: I was dealing with Damon.
Elena: And did you...deal with Damon?
Stefan: Yes. Yeah.
Elena: For four days?
Stefan: You have every right to be upset with me. But can I explain it all to you? Please.
Elena: Sure. When?
Stefan: I gotta be home after school, but The Grill, around four o'clock?
Elena: Ok.
Stefan: Thanks.
Caroline: Stefan, where is Damon? He has some serious apologizing to do.
Stefan: He's gone, Caroline.
Caroline: When is he coming back?
Stefan: He's not coming back. I'm sorry.
Elena: This is a good thing, Caroline.
Caroline: I know that.
Mystic Grill
Elena: Hey, Matt, um, have you seen Stefan?
Matt: Nope. If you want to kill some time, um, you can rack. Come on. We haven't played in forever. I'll let you break.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Zach is going to the cellar.]

Zach: I'm full of vervain. I've been putting it in my coffee for 16 years. My blood will only make you worse. Damon?
Damon: So it was your vervain. Good for you. Good for you. Family only runs so deep.
Zach: We're not family, Damon. Only in the most dysfunctional sense. In fact, I avoided having a living, breathing, loving family because of you.
Damon: I don't guess I could talk you into bringing me a rabbit or something? I'd settle for Stefan's diet at this point.
Zach: You know I can't do that.
Damon: You succeeded, Zach. I'm shutting down. You're like your grandfather. He didn't like it when I came to visit, either.
Zach: But you don't visit, Damon. You appear, unannounced, reminding me that this isn't my house; that you're just permitting me to live here. Hell, that you're permitting me to live.
Damon: Someone had to mow the lawn.
Zach: I came to say good-bye, Damon.
[Damon comes up to the door and grabs Zach by the throat.]

Damon: Unlock it. Unlock the door, Zach.
[Stefan wrestles Zach out of Damon's grasp.]

Stefan: Keep it up, Damon. The more energy you expend, the faster you'll go.
Mystic Grill
Elena: And there's Vicki, all nonchalant in the bathroom like it's no big deal that they're hooking up.
Matt: Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. Your brother and my sister, that's weird.
Elena: Yeah.
[Elena's phone rings.]

Matt: How late is he?
Elena: Hitting the hour mark. Nothing's wrong though. Which means I'm not talking boy problems with you.
[She shoots the cue ball.]

Matt: Good. I mean, it's not like we were ever best friends or anything.
Elena: Ok. Here goes-- What do you think of Stefan? Is he a good guy?
Matt: Why? what's he done?
Elena: Not any one thing. He's just so secretive all the time. I think there's something that he doesn't want me to know, which makes me want to know all the more.
Matt: Like what? Like that he's a serial killer and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk?
Elena: No, of course not. But what do we know about him, really?
Matt: He's great at football. A little bit of a loner. And as much as I hate saying it, he might be a nice guy.
Elena: So you think I'm just being paranoid?
Matt: I think you should talk to him.
[Stefan appears.]

Stefan: Talk to who? I'm so sorry that I'm late.
Elena: What happened?
Stefan: I got held up.
Elena: Is everything ok?
Stefan: There was this thing with my uncle.
Elena: And you couldn't call and tell me that you were going to be an hour late?
Matt: Ok. You two have fun.
Stefan: I'm really sorry. It was unavoidable.
Elena: What was unavoidable? Ok.
[Elena goes to leave.]

Stefan: Oh, uh, Elena, please...
Elena: No, Stefan, don't you get it? Every question gets a vague non-answer. What is so awful that you're afraid to tell me?
[An old man walks up to Stefan.]

Old Man: I know you. My God.
Stefan: I'm sorry?
Old Man: I know you. How can it be?
Stefan: I think you have the wrong person, sir.
Old Man: You haven't aged a day.
Stefan: I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hey, can we...can I take you home and we can talk about it? Is that ok?
[Stefan starts pushing Elena towards the door. She stops.]

Elena: Wait, what was that?
Stefan: I--I don't know. uh, nothing.
Elena: Right, nothing. Ok, um...I gotta go, Stefan. Excuse me.
[Elena leaves.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is writing in her diary in her bedroom.]

Elena: I tried. I want so much to make things right, but every instinct in my body is telling me to be careful. What you don't know can hurt you.
Mystic Grill
Logan: Evening, Sheriff. Anything?
Sheriff Forbes: We went over the entire west side of the lake. All the caverns by the falls were clean, no signs of habitat.
Logan: Then they're staying in town.
Sheriff Forbes: We canvassed all abandoned buildings and warehouses.
Logan: There has to be a private residence.
Sheriff Forbes: And that much harder to locate, if not impossible. These creatures are smart. they know how to go undetected.
Logan: Well, someone who only comes out at night should eventually become obvious.
Sheriff Forbes: What about the watch?
Logan: I'm working on it.
Sheriff Forbes: I knew the Gilberts. That watch is passed down to the men in the family. I'd start with Jeremy.
Jenna: Hey, Logan.
Logan: I can't believe you really came.
Jenna: You have an hour. Make it count.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena is in her bedroom. Jeremy walks in.]

Jeremy: You ok?
Elena: Is Vicki in there?
Jeremy: Don't answer a question with another question. Maybe. What's wrong with you?
Elena: I'm miserable.
Jeremy: Well, you should go get something to eat.
[Elena goes to the kitchen and finds Stefan there.]

Elena: Jenna? Jenna? Stefan? What are you doing here?
Stefan: Dinner. Jeremy told me that Chicken Parmesan is one of your favorites, and I happen to be a good cook. The Italian roots demand it. I can even make my own homemade mozzarella. Only tonight, it is unfortunately store bought. Sorry.
Elena: I don't know what you're trying to accomplish.
Stefan: You want to know me, right? Well, I figure if you're going to dump me, you should at least, um, know who you're dumping. So let's start with Katherine.
Elena: Stefan...
Stefan: She was...the most beautiful girl that I had ever met. She had this perfect olive skin. And she had this laugh. It was ridiculous. I mean, her laugh made you laugh. And she was fun. She knew how to have a good time. But Katherine was also very impatient and entitled and selfish, and, um, impulsive. Enter Damon. He claims that he was with her first. I don't know. I do know that I did some things that...I'm not proud of. And my biggest regret...is not being able to make it right before she died. I miss her, but...I'm no longer crippled by her loss.
Vicki: It was very nice what you did for Stefan. Very romantic.
Jeremy: Well, I was feeling romantic.
Vicki: Look what I found. Elena Gilbert, take one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as needed for pain.
Jeremy: Those are left over from the car accident.
Vicki: So she won't miss them.
[Vicki pours the pills out and grabs the pocketwatch to use to crush the pills up. Jeremy stops her.]

Jeremy: No not with that, that's an antique. I feel like we're always getting high.
Vicki: That's the beauty of choice.
Jeremy: Well, then let's choose not to. I mean, we don't have to be high all the time, right?
Vicki: I really hope you're not one of those guys who, now that we're together, tries to change everything about me.
Jeremy: No.
Vicki: Good.
Stefan: I'm an avid reader, a huge Fitzgerald fan, The Great Gatsby, his masterpiece. But I'm no snob. I love some good Grisham. I think Seinfeld is the best American television show for the past 50 years, but I Love Lucy is all-time. The loving cup episode was the best, I think. Huge Scorsese fan. I can watch Taxi Driver over and over again.
Elena: Here, let me.
[Elena takes up the chopping of the garlic.]

Stefan: As far as music, it's pretty much across the board. Um, Dylan, Hendrix, Patsy, Willie. A little Kanye. You know what? I even like that one Miley song.
[Elena smirks.]

Stefan: Easy.
Elena: I didn't say anything. Hey, this is for the garlic bread, right? Because I'm not eating garlic unless you agree to, too.
Stefan: Are you kidding? I love garlic.
[Elena cuts her finger with the knife.]

Elena: Ow! Ahh.
Stefan: You ok? um...
Elena: Yeah. Think so.
[Elena goes to the sink to wash off her hand. She looks in the window and sees Stefan's face transforming.]

Elena: Your face...
Stefan: I--I, uh, I think I got something in my eye.
Elena: Stefan. Hey. Stefan! Um, I think that my paranoia has turned into full-blown hallucinations.
Stefan: Part of your charm.
[Stefan hesitates to kiss Elena. Elena kisses him first though.]

Forbes Residence
[Caroline is calling someone in her bedroom.]

Damon: Caroline. Caroline.
Caroline: No, Tiki, do not do the one-piece, ok? I've seen it on you. Trust me. Yeah, but you're going for stripper pole vibe this year.
Damon: Caroline.
Caroline: Yeah, maybe we should wash the cars in slow motion. No.
Damon: Caroline.
Caroline: What? oh, um, no, sorry. Um, so I'll just see you tomorrow. Two-piece. Ok, bye.
[A crow is at her window.]

Caroline: Shoo, shoo! Shoo! God!
Salvatore Boarding House
[In the cellar.]

Damon: I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself, aren't you?
Stefan: Not particularly.
Damon: You won. You got the bad guy. Now nothing could come between you and Elena. Except the truth. The lies will catch up to you, Stefan. As long as you keep lying to yourself about what you are.
Stefan: The beauty of you in there and me out here...is that I can walk away.
Sexy Suds Car Wash
Caroline: No friend discounts. No freebies. No pay ya laters. We are not running a charity here. No, we are not.
Elena: No we are not.
[Stefan arrives.]

Stefan: Hi.
Elena: Hey!
Caroline: The event is called sexy suds, you know.
Stefan: Did we just get scolded?
Elena: And judged, yeah.
Stefan: Wow.
Elena: I'm sorry, but I guess you're going to have to take that off.
Stefan: I think you have to go first.
Elena: Ok.
[Elena pulls off her shirt but has trouble getting it off. Stefan helps her.]

Elena: Ok, um--sorry, So not sexy. Ugh.
Stefan: I disagree.
[They kiss.]

Bonnie: uh-uh, no. None of that tortured pining stuff.
Matt: I'm just observing.
Bonnie: Mm-hmm. Oh. Tiki. this one's yours.
Tiki: Why do I always get the homely ones? Just to be clear, your car's a P.O.S. I mean, we can wash it, but it's still a P.O.S.
Bonnie: You don't have to be rude.
Tiki: Rude is uglying up the road with that junk.
[Bonnie uses her powers to splash water on Tiki.]

Tiki: Whoa! What the hell?
Matt: Wet and wild, Tik.
Logan: All proceeds are going to the school's athletic department still healing from the tragic death of their football coach William Tanner. The citizens of Mystic Falls coming together in support of one of their own. Cut it.
Jenna: Classy.
Logan: Thank you.
Jenna: But you're still going to video the girls in bikinis, right?
Logan: Well, 53 percent of Americans watch the news with the sound off.
Jenna: Thank you for dinner. I had a nice time.
Logan: Do you remember the last time we were in the school parking lot?
Jenna: Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.
Logan: Really?
Jenna: Nada. Especially not having sex in the minivan.
Logan: That was a good day. What?
Elena: You're getting soap in that.
Stefan: Oh, it's fine.
Elena: I noticed that Damon has one, too. Is there a story behind it?
Stefan: Yeah, it's the family crest from the Italian renaissance.
Elena: Hmm. What's the stone?
Stefan: It's called lapis lazuli.
Elena: Oh. You should really take it off. I could put it in my bag.
Stefan: No, it's...it's fine, really. Thanks, though.
Elena: Ok. I'm gonna get some towels.
Stefan: Ok.
Elena: Hey, we're out of towels and those shimmy things.
Caroline: I'll go get some more. Mind the money.
[Caroline is walking through the halls of the school. She sees a shadow, she hears Damon's voice.]

Damon: Caroline. Caroline, help me. Caroline. Help me. Help me.
Elena: That'll be $20. I saw you last night. You were talking to a friend of mine. At the grill?
Old Man: Well, I...I thought it was somebody I knew.
Elena: Stefan Salvatore.
Old Man: Nah, it can't be. It's just my mind playing tricks on me.
Elena: Where do you think you'd seen him before?
Old Man: When I first moved here, I stayed at the Salvatore boarding house.
Elena: Oh.
Old Man: Stefan was just passing through to visit his uncle. I mean, none of us knew he was even here until the attack.
Elena: The attack?
Old Man: His uncle got killed. Mauled by an animal in the woods.
Elena: His uncle? Zach?
Old Man: Mm-mmm. Joseph.
Elena: I'm sorry, sir. I don't think I'm familiar with the story.
Old Man: Oh, how could you? I mean, this happened years ago.
Tiki: Grandpa, you gotta go. Mom wants you home. Ok?
Old Man: Ah.
Tiki: He wasn't bugging you, was he? He's a little alzy-heimer.
Elena: No, he was sweet. Hey, sir, I'm sorry. Um, are you sure that the man that you saw, that you knew, his name was Stefan Salvatore?
Old Man: Yes. I remember his ring and his brother--
Elena: Damon?
Old Man: Yeah. Stefan and Damon Salvatore.
Elena: When was this?
Old Man: It was early June, 1953. Yeah. June, 1953.
Stefan: Caroline finally freed you, huh?
Elena: Uh, I don't know where she went. She abandoned me. Hey, I realized earlier, I had no idea that your family was from Italy.
Stefan: No? Last name Salvatore didn't do it for you?
Elena: Right. Duh. Are there any other Salvatores in Mystic Falls?
Stefan: My uncle Zach.
Elena: Where did everyone else go?
Stefan: Kinda just spread out.
Elena: Hmm.
Stefan: Why?
Elena: I'm just trying to learn more about you.
Stefan: Hmm.
Woods
Jeremy: Where are you taking me?
Vicki: We can't hide out in your room all the time. Welcome to my other favorite party place.
Jeremy: What, a cemetery?
Vicki: Yeah. It's cool, huh?
Jared: Yo, Vick!
Vicki: What's up, Jared?
Boy: You baby-sitting, Donovan?
Vicki: This is Jeremy. He's cool.
Boy: Smoke up.
Sexy Suds Car Wash
Elena: Your car was done an hour ago.
Jenna: You're saying that out loud why?
Logan: Hi. Elena, right? I think I met you once when you were 9.
Elena: Oh.
Jenna: Your emotional maturity level when we were together.
Logan: Ouch. Here i thought we were making progress.
Elena: Is he enough in your good graces that i can ask him for a favor?
Logan: If i do her a favor, will i get back in your good graces?
Jenna: Uh, a very reluctant maybe to both.
Logan: Done. Wait. One condition. Dinner, tonight, your house.
Jenna: Fine. But you're eating leftovers.
Logan: Ooh. What do you need?
Elena: Do you have access to old news stories, say, fifties?
Logan: Yeah, at the station. Between the archives and the Internet, we pretty much have everything.
Elena: I have this report way past due. It'd be a life saver.
Logan: Heading there now. Let's go.
Elena: If anyone asks, you don't know where I went. I don't want Caroline to know that I left.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Caroline enters and goes in the cellar.]

Damon: Caroline, help me. Caroline. Help me.
Caroline: Damon? Damon? Damon? Oh, my god! What is this? How did I know that you were here?
Damon: Because I wanted you to. Very, very badly. Let me out of here. Please.
Caroline: You bit me.
Damon: You liked it. Remember?
Caroline: Why do I keep remembering the same things, but in different ways?
Damon: You remember what I want you to remember. And now that the vervain has passed out of your system, you won't remember what you're about to do.
Caroline: What am I about to do?
Damon: You're gonna open the door. You're gonna open the door.
Zach: No! No! Get out of here. Run! Run!
[Caroline runs. Damon kills Zach. Damon tries to catch Caroline, but the sun burns him.]

Sexy Suds Car Wash
Tiki: Sweeper duty.
Bonnie: What?
Tiki: We have to clean the pavement.
Bonnie: It's a car wash. By definition, the pavement's clean.
Tiki: But not dry.
Bonnie: And I'm doing this why?
Tiki: Caroline bailed, so that leaves me in charge. Fabulous.
[With her powers, Bonnie starts a fire and Tiki's car burns.]

Stefan: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Hey.
Bonnie: What just happened?
Stefan: You were in some kind of a trance.
Bonnie: Did I do this?
Stefan: I think so, yeah.
Bonnie: Nobody else saw, did they? Don't tell anybody. Please.
TV Station
Logan: We digitized all our archives last year. You can pull all the remote footage right up on screen. What is it exactly you're looking for?
Elena: An incident from 1953. If it even happened--at the old Salvatore boarding house.
[Logan's cell phone rings.]

Logan: Sorry, one second. Yeah? Fire? All right, be right there. I gotta go. You believe there's actual news to cover in this town? All right, use keywords to search the database. It's pretty easy to navigate. And Brady down in tech will help you out with anything you need.
Elena: Ok.
Logan: All right? Oh, hey. Could you put in a good word for me with Jenna?
Elena: You got it.
Logan: All right. Good luck.
Cemetery
Vicki: What?
Jeremy: I'm stoned in a cemetery.
Vicki: They don't mind, they're dead. Let me take this up a notch. Hey, Tony.
Tony: Oh! Nice. Vickies from Vicki. Ha!
Girl: Well, thank you, Elena Gilbert, whoever you are.
Jeremy: You took those from the house?
Vicki: She wasn't using it.
Jeremy: She's gonna notice if they're gone. That's not cool.
Vicki: It's no big deal, Jer.
Jeremy: Yeah, it kinda is, Vick.
Boy: Damn, dude.
Tony: Vicki brought the party police.
Vicki: Shut up, Tony. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad.
Jeremy: Well, what are we doing, partying in a cemetery with a bunch of losers?
Vicki: Those are my friends.
Jeremy: They're waste of space small-town lifers.
Vicki: Yeah? What am I?
Jeremy: You're different, Vick.
Vicki: No, you are. You're the kid with the big house who's acting out because his parents died. Guess what-- You'll get over it. You will pull yourself together, move on, and one day tell your kids stories about your dark period growing up. And I'll still be here, waiting tables at the grill, partying at the cemetery with a bunch of waste of space small-town lifers.
Jeremy: Look--
Vicki: Go home, Jeremy. If I want to feel like crap about myself, I'll just go back to Tyler.
Sexy Suds Car Wash
Stefan: Hey, have you seen Elena?
Matt: No, not for a while.
Stefan: You think she went home?
Matt: Not sure.
Stefan: Thanks.
Matt: Hey. I'm not saying this for you. I'm saying it for her. But she's big on trust. So whatever you're holding back from her, the more you try to hide it, the more she won't stop till she figures it out.
TV Station
[Elena looks at some footage.]

Voice: This is Franklin Fell reporting to you from the Salvatore Boarding House, where a brutal animal attack has ended in tragedy. Ok, they're bringing out the bodies. See if you can get closer. Is that the nephew?
[As the camera zooms in, Elena sees Stefan in the background.]

Forbes Residence
[In Caroline's bedroom.]

Sheriff Forbes: I didn't see you at the car wash.
Caroline: Left early.
Sheriff Forbes: Honey, are you ok? Anything you want to talk about? Is it a boy thing?
Caroline: Mom, if I want to talk boys, I'll call dad. At least he's successfully dating one.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan finds Zach dead and Damon gone.]

Stefan: Zach! Oh, no, Zach...
Gilbert Residence
Elena: Dear diary, I'm not a believer. People are born, they grow old, and then they die. That's the world we live in. There's no magic, no mysticism, no immortality. There's nothing that defies rational thought.
Gram's Residence
[Bonnie goes to her grandmother.]

Bonnie: I don't know what's happening to me.
Grams: I know, dear.
Bonnie: Oh, Grams.
Gilbert Residence
[Logan steals Jeremy's watch.]

Jenna: Logan? Logan?
Elena: People are supposed to be who they say they are. And not lie or hide their true selves.
Jeremy: What are you doing here?
Logan: Oh, hey, man. Just looking for the bathroom.
Elena: It's not possible. I'm not a believer, I can't be. But how can I deny what's right in front of me? Someone who never grows old...
[Flashback]

Old Man: 1953.
Elena: Never gets hurt...
[Flashback]

Elena: Oh, my god, your hand! Is it deep? How bad is it?
Elena: Someone who changes in ways that can't be explained...
[Flashback]

Elena: Hey, um, are you ok? Your eye. Your face.
Elena: Girls bitten...
[Flashback]

Elena: What is that? Oh, my god, what happened to you?
Caroline: It's nothing!
Elena: Bodies drained of blood...
[Flashback]

Elena: Did she say what kind of animal it was?
Matt: She said it was a vampire.
Cemetery
[Music stops.]

Boy: Donovan?
Vicki: No, I'm good.
Guys: Not it. Not it. Not it. Ah, Vicki.
[Vicki goes to the car. Damon is here, coughing, groaning.]

Vicki: Hey, man, you ok?
Damon: Come here. Come here.
Vicki: You don't look good.
Damon: Come closer. I have something...that I have to tell you.
Vicki: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you, I got you. It's ok. it's ok.
[Damon bites her.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan grabs a stake and runs to the door. Elena is outside when he opens the door.]

Elena: What are you?

Salvatore Estate 1864
[Stefan runs out of the Salvatore boarding house with a wooden stake that he got out of the basement until the flashback of him waiting on the doorstep of the old Salvatore estate appears with a flash of light. A carriage arrives in front of him. Birdie Mae exits the carriage first then Katherine exits the carriage and observes him for a moment then Stefan approaches her after Birdie finishes smoothing out Katherine's dress.]

Stefan: You must be Miss Pierce.
Katherine: Please, call me Katherine.

Salvatore Boarding House
Elena: What are you? What are you?
Stefan: You know.
Elena: No, I don't.
Stefan: Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be here.
Elena: It's not possible. It can't be.
Stefan: Everything you know...And every belief that you have is about to change. Are you ready for that?
Elena: What are you?
Stefan: I'm a vampire.
Elena: I shouldn't have come.
Stefan: No. Please.
[Elena tries to run away, but Stefan appears in front of her.]

Elena: No. No. How did you do that?
Stefan: Please don't be afraid of me.
Elena: Let me go.
Stefan: No. Elena, there's things that you have to know and understand.
Elena: Let me go!
Stefan: Elena, please.
[Elena gets into her car and drives away.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena arrives and runs to her room where she begins to freak out then Stefan appears again.]

Stefan: Elena.[she tries to run out of her room until Stefan pushes the door shut and corners Elena against the door] I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Elena: All those animal attacks, those people who died...
Stefan: No. That was Damon!
Elena: Damon?
Stefan: Yes. I don't drink human blood. That's not how I choose to survive, but Damon does! I'll explain everything to you, but I beg you, Elena, do not tell anybody.
Elena: How can you ask me that?
Stefan: Because you knowing this is dangerous for so many reasons. You can hate me, but I need you to trust me.
Elena: Just go. Just go, please. Go. If you mean me no harm, then you'll go!
Stefan: I never wanted this.
[Stefan leaves.]

Cemetery
[Damon burns the bodies. He calls Stefan on a cellphone.]

Stefan: Hello?
Damon: I want my ring.
Stefan: Where are you?
Damon: I'm at the sizzler. I had the buffet. Where's my ring?
Stefan: I don't have it. Where are you? What have you done?
Damon: No, what have you done? You're the one that locked me in the basement and starved me, so whatever I've done, whoever I've sucked dry is on you, buddy.
Stefan: You're being careless. How many more animal attacks is this town gonna believe, huh?
Damon: I know how to cover my tracks, Stefan. Where's my ring?
Stefan: I gave it to Zach to hide. Probably shouldn't have killed him.
Damon: ...Ah, you almost got me. Where is it?
Stefan: I'll get it back, but I need time.
Damon: What, did you FedEx it to Rome?! Where is it? I want my ring, Stefan, or my next stop's Elena's.
Stefan: I already want you dead. Don't give me another reason to make it happen.
Damon: Don't give me another reason to rip you apart.
Stefan: Yeah? Is that gonna be before or after you get your ring back?
Damon: Just get it.
[He hangs. He goes over to Vicki and pours alcohol on her to burn her body. She wakes up.]

Damon: You just don't wanna die, do you?
[Elena is sleeping. Stefan is outside her house, guarding her family from Damon.]

Mystic Grill
Elena: You said you would explain everything. That's why I asked you to meet me here. When you Google vampire you get a world of fiction. What's the reality?
Stefan: I can tell you whatever you wanna know.
Elena: I know you eat garlic.
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: And somehow, sunlight's not an issue.
[A waitress arrives.]

Waitress: Hi, here are your drinks.
Elena: Thank you.
[The waitress leaves.]

Stefan: We have rings that protect us.
Elena: Crucifixes?
Stefan: Decorative.
Elena: Holy water?
Stefan: Drinkable.
Elena: Mirrors?
Stefan: Myth.
Elena: You said you don't kill to survive.
Stefan: Animal blood keeps me alive, but not as strong as Damon. He can be very powerful.
Elena: And yet you let him get involved with Caroline?
Stefan: Forcing Damon not to do something is much more dangerous, believe me.
Elena: He was hurting her!
Stefan: He was feeding on her. He was able to take away her memories of being bitten using a form of mind compulsion. She never knew what was happening to her. If he wanted to kill her, he would have.
Elena: Is that supposed to make it ok?
Stefan: No. No, none of this is ok, Elena. I know that.
Elena: Are there any others, aside from you and Damon?
Stefan: Not in Mystic Falls; not anymore.
Elena: Not anymore?
Stefan: There was a time when this town was...very much aware of vampires, and it didn't end well for anybody. That's why it's important that you don't tell anyone.
Elena: I can't promise that.
Stefan: Elena...Give me today. I will answer any questions that you have, and when it's over, you can decide for yourself what you wanna do with what you know. It'll be your choice.
Cemetery
[Logan arrives and starts talking to Sheriff Forbes. There are charred bodies on the ground.]

Logan: Never smelled one this bad before.
Sheriff Forbes: It tried to cover its tracks.
Logan: Are you sure?
Sheriff Forbes: I'm positive. You only burn a corpse to try to hide cause of death, and there are no shell casings.
Logan: We know who they are?
Sheriff Forbes: Doc'll have to check their dental records.
Logan: What story should i run?
Sheriff Forbes: Drug deal gone bad. It's not too big a stretch.
Logan: I got the Gilbert watch.
Sheriff Forbes: Good.
[One of the deputies arrives.]

Policeman: Found this in the brush about 10 yards away.
[He shows her Vicki's ID.]

Sheriff Forbes: Vicki Donovan.
Logan: You know her?
Sheriff Forbes: I went to high school with her mother.
Logan: Think she's one of these?
Sheriff Forbes: I hope not.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Vicki is on a sofa. Damon leaves a message on Stefan's phone.]

Damon: Where are you, Stefan? I'm trapped at the house, and I'm getting really bored and really impatient, and I don't do bored and impatient. Bring me my ring. Damn it.
[He sees Vicki bleeding more on the couch.]

Damon: Aw, don't get blood on the couch!
[Walks over.]

Damon: Please? I got you good, didn't I?
[She doesn't answer.]

Damon: Well, you're not gonna be any fun today. I'm so gonna regret this.
[Damon bites his wrist and puts it to her mouth. She struggles but eventually gives in.]

Damon: Drink up. Drink it up. Don't drip. There you go. Good girl. That's it.
Woods
[Elena and Stefan are driving through the woods in Elena's car.]

Stefan: Stop here.
Elena: What are we doing here?
[They get out of the car.]

Stefan: I want to show you something.
Elena: In the middle of nowhere?
Stefan: This...Didn't used to be nowhere. Used to be my home.
Elena: It looks so...
Stefan: Old? It's because they are.
Elena: Wait. How long have you...
Stefan: I've been 17 years old since 1864.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: You said you wanted to know. I'm not gonna hold anything back. Half a century before the boarding house was even built, this was my family's home. Damon and I...We were both born here. The Salvatore brothers, best friends.
Salvatore Estate 1864
[Stefan and Damon run out of the house, playing football.]

Stefan: Wait. Where did you learn this game?
Damon: Camp outside Atlanta. One of the officers picked it up at Harvard. Catch.
[Damon throws the ball and Stefan catches it.]

Stefan: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are the rules? What are the rules?
[Stefan and Damon playfully struggle for the ball when Katherine exits the house.]

Katherine: Who needs rules? Mind if I join you?
Stefan: Uh, well, you could, uh...you could get hurt. My brother likes to play rough.
Katherine: Somehow, I think that you play rougher.
[She snatches the ball from Stefan and runs off. Stefan stares a longing stare at Katherine as she runs off.]

Damon: Why are you just standing there? That is a girl who clearly wants to be chased. If you don't do it, I will.
[They both chase after her.]

Salvatore Estate Ruins
Elena: You knew Katherine in 1864? Damon made it seem like...
Stefan: Damon was trying to make you think that...I was still heartbroken. He saw that I was happy with you, and he wanted to ruin it.
Elena: All because you loved the same women 145 years ago?
Stefan: She wasn't just any girl.
Salvatore Estate 1864
[Stefan is chasing Katherine through a garden maze. Katherine reaches a statue and they both stop running.]

Katherine: Ha! I win. What's my prize?
Damon: What would you like it to be?
Stefan: [smiles] They extended your leave?
Damon: I was simply having too much fun to return to battle.
Stefan: Your commitment to the confederacy is inspiring.
[Stefan walks over and hugs him.]

Katherine: Well, this works out wonderfully for me.
Damon: How's that, miss Katherine?
Katherine: Now I'll have both of you here to keep me entertained. First and foremost, I'll need someone to escort me to the founder's ball.
Damon and Stefan: With pleasure. I would be honored.
Katherine: The smart and kind Salvatore brothers both coming to my rescue. How will I ever choose?
[She walks away.]

Salvatore Estate Ruins
[Elena and Stefan walk about the ruins of the old estate.]

Stefan: She chose me. I escorted her to the ball at the original Lockwood mansion.
Elena: The first founder's party...Where you signed the registry.
Stefan: I didn't care that I had gotten something that my brother wanted. I didn't even care if it hurt him. I only knew that I wanted her.
Elena: So he was upset.
Stefan: That's the thing about Damon. He doesn't get mad. He just gets even.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is playing music.]

Vicki: Oh, man. That shower was so great. What did you give me?
Damon: Some blood. You loved it.
Vicki: I did? Wait. I'm confused. How did we get here?
Damon: We met in the woods. You were drunk. I attacked you. Then I killed all of your friends and brought you here, gave you same blood. You loved it. And now we're gonna party till the sun goes down.
Vicki: Ok. Um, but first, can I have another hit? That blood was so good.
Damon: Only if I can.
[Damon bites his wrist and gives it to Vicki to feed while he drinks from her wrist.]

Salvatore Estate Ruins
Stefan: What Damon wants, Damon usually gets. I didn't know it at the time, but...Turns out that night...Katherine was with him, too.
Elena: So he stole her from you, not the other way around?
Stefan: Turns out she wasn't ours to steal.
Salvatore Estate 1864
[Stefan is with Katherine in her room making out and they almost start making love.]

Stefan: I will love you forever.
Katherine: Forever is a very long time, you know.
Stefan: Not long enough.
[Katherine elongates her fangs and bites him. The next morning, her handmaiden, Birdie, is helping her get dressed when Stefan wakes up.]

Katherine: Good morning. Clear the room, please.
[Birdie leaves.]

Katherine: You're upset.
Stefan: Your face, it was like a demon.
Katherine: But you're not afraid.
Stefan: Get away from me. Get away.
Katherine: [compels him] It doesn't change the way you feel about me. You will not tell anyone.
Stefan: I...
Katherine: Shh. We will go on exactly as we have.
Stefan: Yes. We will go on.
Katherine: You have no idea of the future I have planned for us, Stefan...You, me, and Damon. No rules.
Salvatore Estate Ruins
Stefan: She could control my mind; and Damon's. She compelled each of us to keep the secret from the other. She wanted all of us to be together. Forever. Didn't work out that way, but...Damon and I, looks like we're stuck with each other...Like it or not.
[He pulls out Damon's ring from a ruin.]

Elena: Is that Damon's ring?
Stefan: I took it from him, but I have to give it back.
Elena: No, don't, Stefan. Keep it hidden.
Stefan: Elena, if I don't give it to him, he'll retaliate in the only way that he knows he can hurt me.
Elena: And how is that?
Stefan: By hurting you.
Lockwood House
Sheriff Forbes: We're working on it, Mayor Lockwood.
Mr Lockwood: Doc ID the bodies?
Sheriff Forbes: A few townies. Notorious druggies.
Mr Lockwood: I suppose that'll make it easy for people to buy the story. And Vicki Donovan?
Sheriff Forbes: She's not one of the deceased.
Mr Lockwood: Where the hell is she?
Sheriff Forbes: I wish I knew.
Logan: Sorry I'm late.
Mr Lockwood: You have the watch? It's ready.
Logan: That's it?
Mr Lockwood: Yes. That's it.
[He gives him the vampire compass.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Vicki is dancing.]

Vicki: I am so over Tyler, so over him. I knew from the beginning that I was only a piece of ass to him, but i thought maybe if he got to know me better, he might see something more. But no. Now, Jeremy, on the other hand, that's all he's ever seen in me is something more, and i like that.
Damon: Jeremy, huh? Elena's brother?
Vicki: Yeah, yeah. So, Elena used to date my brother, and they were always together, so Jeremy would always be hanging around and crushing on me and...Hey, why don't you have a girlfriend? You're, like, totally cool and so hot.
Damon: I know.
Vicki: Don't you wanna be in love?
Damon: I've been in love. It's painful and pointless and overrated.
Vicki: Except when it isn't.
Damon: No more talking. Let's dance.
Vicki: My mom spends most of her time in Virginia beach with Pete. He drives trucks. I don't remember my dad, but from what I gather, he's not worth remembering.
Damon: Your life is so pathetic.
Vicki: Yeah. I mean, I'm the screwed-up one. Matt's got it so easy. He's the golden boy. I mean, he's gonna get a football scholarship and marry Elena and have a lawn mower and some babies, and when i think of my future, I just come up blank.
Damon: You are so damaged.
Vicki: Yep.
Damon: I mean, you don't have one hint of self-esteem.
Vicki: Nope, none.
Damon: I think I know what can help you.
Vicki: So what's that?
Damon: Death.
[He kills her. After few minutes, Vicki wakes up, as a vampire.]

Vicki: What happened? We were dancing, and then...
Damon: Then I killed you.
Vicki: What?
Damon: You're dead.
Vicki: I'm dead?
Damon: Yeah, well, let's not make a big deal out of it. You drank my blood, I killed you, and now you have to feed in order to complete the process.
Vicki: You're wasted.
Damon: You don't wanna be out there all alone. You're about to get really freaky.
Vicki: Ok, I had a really good time. I just wanna go home.
Damon: You're gonna start craving blood, and until you get it, you're gonna feel very out of it. You have to be careful.
Vicki: Come on, move.
Damon: See? you're already starting to fall apart.
Vicki: And I'm going home now.
Damon: Ok, fine. I'm just warning you. Actually, you know what? You should go. In fact, if I were you, I would stop by your boyfriend Jeremy's house.
Vicki: Yeah, whatever.
Damon: Bye. Tell Elena I said hi and if you see Stefan, tell him to call me.
Woods
Sheriff Forbes: I got Stanley on the Moore street entrance. The rest of us will cover other access points. Call him or call me if that thing goes off. Don't use the radio. Cellphones only.
Logan: Got it.
Sheriff Forbes: You've got 8 rounds. Remember, wood bullets won't kill him, but it'll wound him enough for you to get close and stake him. You sure you can handle this?
Logan: Of course I can.
Sheriff Forbes: You ever staked a vampire before?
Logan: Have you?
Gilbert Residence
[Doorbell ringing.]

Jeremy: I'm Coming!
Vicki: Hey. The sun is killing me. My eyes are on fire.
Jeremy: Where have you been?
Vicki: It's good. Everything's good.
[They began to kiss.]

Jeremy: Did something happen?
Vicki: I'm hungry. What do you got to eat?
Jeremy: You're high? Vicki, it's the middle of the day.
Vicki: Could you just not talk so loud? My head, it hurts. I need quiet.
Salvatore Estate Ruins
Elena: The mind control...You said Katherine used. Do you ever do that to me?
Stefan: No. That necklace, it contains an herb called vervain. It protects you from being compelled. I wanted to protect you from Damon's influence. But I also wanted to...Protect you from me. Elena, you should never take that necklace off...Because no matter what happens after today, no matter how you feel about me...You'll know that you were free to make your own choice.
Gilbert Residence
Matt: Where is she?
Jeremy: Come this way.
Matt: What's she on?
Jeremy: I...I don't know.
Matt: Hey, Vic. How you doin'?
Vicki: Not good, Mattie. I hurt.
Matt: Ok, where's it hurt?
Vicki: My gums. My jaw hurts. My gum...there's something in my gums, and it hurts.
Matt: Ok, well...
Vicki: No. Just leave me alone.
Matt: Come on, Vic. Don't be like that. Let's get you home.
Vicki: Just turn it off!
Jeremy: Turn what off?
Vicki: The talking, the chatter, just turn it off.
[TV sound is inaudible.]

Man on TV: ...horribly. Three bodies were found dead in what is believed to be a drug deal gone awry. The bodies have yet to be identified. They were discovered earlier today over at the old Mystic Falls cemetery.
Jeremy: That's where we were last night.
Matt: What happened, Vic?
Man on TV: ...homicide, and are fast under way looking for suspects. They're asking anyone with information...
Matt: I'm calling the cops.
Vicki: No. Don't.
Jeremy: What happened after I left last night, Vick?
[Vicki pushes Jeremy.]

Matt: Jer, are you ok ?
Jeremy: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Matt: Damn, Vick.
[Elena and Stefan enter the house.]

Elena: What's going on?
Matt: She's really messed up.
Stefan: Elena, back up. Vicki, look at me. Focus. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Guys, take her up to bed. Shut the blinds. She's gonna be ok. Come on. Come on.
[Matt and Jeremy take Vicki upstairs.]

Elena: You know what's wrong with her?
Stefan: Yeah.
Elena: What is it?
Stefan: She's transitioning.
Elena: Transitioning to what?
Stefan: A vampire.
Elena: What?
Stefan: Damon must have gotten to her. She's new. She hasn't completed her transformation yet.
Elena: H-how does she do that?
Stefan: She has to feed on human blood.
Elena: And what if she doesn't?
Stefan: She'll die. She may only have a few hours.
Elena: She's upstairs with him right now.
Stefan: It's ok. She doesn't know what's happening to her yet.
Elena: So when is she gonna know?
Stefan: Right now, she doesn't remember anything. A part of her is still human, but slowly, the deeper she gets into the transition, the memories will start to come back, and then she'll know she has to make the choice.
Elena: The same choice you made?
[In the bedroom.]

Vicki: I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.
Jeremy: Aw, you just...you need to sleep it off, ok?
[Jeremy hugs her. Her mouth is near his neck and she seems like she's about to bite him, when she gets up and leaves.]

Vicki: No.
Matt: Vick. Vicki!
Jeremy: She was fine, and then she just...she just freaked out.
Matt: I'm gonna go look for her. Call me if you hear anything.
Stefan: I can track her.
Elena: Go.
Woods
[Cellphone rings.]

Sheriff Forbes: Yeah.
Logan: I think I got something. It's pointing towards the old cemetery.
Sheriff Forbes: Headed your way.
Gilbert Residence
Jeremy: Maybe we should check in with Matt.
Elena: He'll call when he finds her.
Jeremy: Well, what are we supposed to do?
Elena: We wait. We're supposed to wait.
Jeremy: I don't know what's wrong with her.
Elena: She'll be fine. It'll all be fine.
[Doorbell rings. It's Damon. Elena tries to shut the door on him but he pushes back.]

Elena: Jeremy, go upstairs.
Damon: You're afraid of me. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess. Stefan finally 'fessed up.
Elena: Stay away from me.
Damon: Hey, there's no need to be rude. I'm just looking for Stefan. May I come in? Oh, wait. Of course I can. I've been invited. We can cut to the chase if you want. I'm not gonna kill you right now. That wouldn't serve my greater agenda. So...Where's Stefan?
Elena: He's out looking for Vicki.
Damon: Don't look at me with those judgey little eyes. Girl's gonna thank me for what I did to her.
Elena: Did you thank Katherine?
Damon: Mmm. Got the whole life story, huh?
Elena: I got enough.
Damon: Oh, I doubt that. Tell my brother I'm looking for him. Oh, tip for later, be careful who you invite in the house.
Cemetery
Stefan: Vicki.
Vicki: I'm starting to remember things, what he is, what he said. I remember you. The hospital, the...the rooftop, it's all coming back.
Stefan: I'm so sorry. Damon had no right to do this to you.
Vicki: He said that I need to feed. What will happen if i don't?
Stefan: You'll fade quickly...And then it'll all just be over.
Vicki: I'll be dead.
Stefan: Hey.
Vicki: I don't want this.
Stefan: I know. It'll be ok. You're gonna be ok. I can help you.
Vicki: Is it better? Is it better? Will I be better? I wanna go home. Will you take me home?
Stefan: Ok.
[Gunshots. Stefan is hurt.]

Stefan: Ahh!
Vicki: No!
[Damon bites Logan and takes the bullet out of Stefan's chest.]

Damon: It's wood. They know. If anyone's gonna kill you, it's gonna be me. My ring.
[Vicki is drinking Logan's blood.]

Stefan: No! No! Vicki!
Vicki: I'm sorry.
Damon: Oops.
[Damon picks up the compass.]

[Sheriff Forbes finds Logan.]

Sheriff Forbes: Oh god...The watch. Find the watch.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena is waiting for Stefan in front of the house.]

Elena: You're bleeding.
Stefan: No, it's ok. It's ok. I'm ok.
Stefan: I couldn't stop her. I tried.
Elena: What does that mean?
Stefan: She fed, and then I lost her.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: I'll take care of it. I'll find her, and I will show her that she can live like I do. I will make sure that she does not hurt anybody, Elena. I promise you.
Elena: What do I tell my brother and...and Matt?
Stefan: We'll come up with a story.
Elena: You mean we'll come up with a lie.
Stefan: I'm so sorry.
Elena: I gave you today just like you asked. And I understand that you would never do anything to hurt me, and I promise I will keep your secret, but...I can't be with you, Stefan. I'm sorry. I...I just can't...
[Elena walks into the house, falls to the floor and cries.]

Salvatore Boarding House
Elena: What are you? What are you?
Stefan: You know.
Elena: No, I don't.
Stefan: Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be here.
Elena: It's not possible. It can't be.
Stefan: Everything you know...And every belief that you have is about to change. Are you ready for that?
Elena: What are you?
Stefan: I'm a vampire.
Elena: I shouldn't have come.
Stefan: No. Please.
[Elena tries to run away, but Stefan appears in front of her.]

Elena: No. No. How did you do that?
Stefan: Please don't be afraid of me.
Elena: Let me go.
Stefan: No. Elena, there's things that you have to know and understand.
Elena: Let me go!
Stefan: Elena, please.
[Elena gets into her car and drives away.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena arrives and runs to her room where she begins to freak out then Stefan appears again.]

Stefan: Elena.[she tries to run out of her room until Stefan pushes the door shut and corners Elena against the door] I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Elena: All those animal attacks, those people who died...
Stefan: No. That was Damon!
Elena: Damon?
Stefan: Yes. I don't drink human blood. That's not how I choose to survive, but Damon does! I'll explain everything to you, but I beg you, Elena, do not tell anybody.
Elena: How can you ask me that?
Stefan: Because you knowing this is dangerous for so many reasons. You can hate me, but I need you to trust me.
Elena: Just go. Just go, please. Go. If you mean me no harm, then you'll go!
Stefan: I never wanted this.
[Stefan leaves.]

Cemetery
[Damon burns the bodies. He calls Stefan on a cellphone.]

Stefan: Hello?
Damon: I want my ring.
Stefan: Where are you?
Damon: I'm at the sizzler. I had the buffet. Where's my ring?
Stefan: I don't have it. Where are you? What have you done?
Damon: No, what have you done? You're the one that locked me in the basement and starved me, so whatever I've done, whoever I've sucked dry is on you, buddy.
Stefan: You're being careless. How many more animal attacks is this town gonna believe, huh?
Damon: I know how to cover my tracks, Stefan. Where's my ring?
Stefan: I gave it to Zach to hide. Probably shouldn't have killed him.
Damon: ...Ah, you almost got me. Where is it?
Stefan: I'll get it back, but I need time.
Damon: What, did you FedEx it to Rome?! Where is it? I want my ring, Stefan, or my next stop's Elena's.
Stefan: I already want you dead. Don't give me another reason to make it happen.
Damon: Don't give me another reason to rip you apart.
Stefan: Yeah? Is that gonna be before or after you get your ring back?
Damon: Just get it.
[He hangs. He goes over to Vicki and pours alcohol on her to burn her body. She wakes up.]

Damon: You just don't wanna die, do you?
[Elena is sleeping. Stefan is outside her house, guarding her family from Damon.]

Mystic Grill
Elena: You said you would explain everything. That's why I asked you to meet me here. When you Google vampire you get a world of fiction. What's the reality?
Stefan: I can tell you whatever you wanna know.
Elena: I know you eat garlic.
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: And somehow, sunlight's not an issue.
[A waitress arrives.]

Waitress: Hi, here are your drinks.
Elena: Thank you.
[The waitress leaves.]

Stefan: We have rings that protect us.
Elena: Crucifixes?
Stefan: Decorative.
Elena: Holy water?
Stefan: Drinkable.
Elena: Mirrors?
Stefan: Myth.
Elena: You said you don't kill to survive.
Stefan: Animal blood keeps me alive, but not as strong as Damon. He can be very powerful.
Elena: And yet you let him get involved with Caroline?
Stefan: Forcing Damon not to do something is much more dangerous, believe me.
Elena: He was hurting her!
Stefan: He was feeding on her. He was able to take away her memories of being bitten using a form of mind compulsion. She never knew what was happening to her. If he wanted to kill her, he would have.
Elena: Is that supposed to make it ok?
Stefan: No. No, none of this is ok, Elena. I know that.
Elena: Are there any others, aside from you and Damon?
Stefan: Not in Mystic Falls; not anymore.
Elena: Not anymore?
Stefan: There was a time when this town was...very much aware of vampires, and it didn't end well for anybody. That's why it's important that you don't tell anyone.
Elena: I can't promise that.
Stefan: Elena...Give me today. I will answer any questions that you have, and when it's over, you can decide for yourself what you wanna do with what you know. It'll be your choice.
Cemetery
[Logan arrives and starts talking to Sheriff Forbes. There are charred bodies on the ground.]

Logan: Never smelled one this bad before.
Sheriff Forbes: It tried to cover its tracks.
Logan: Are you sure?
Sheriff Forbes: I'm positive. You only burn a corpse to try to hide cause of death, and there are no shell casings.
Logan: We know who they are?
Sheriff Forbes: Doc'll have to check their dental records.
Logan: What story should i run?
Sheriff Forbes: Drug deal gone bad. It's not too big a stretch.
Logan: I got the Gilbert watch.
Sheriff Forbes: Good.
[One of the deputies arrives.]

Policeman: Found this in the brush about 10 yards away.
[He shows her Vicki's ID.]

Sheriff Forbes: Vicki Donovan.
Logan: You know her?
Sheriff Forbes: I went to high school with her mother.
Logan: Think she's one of these?
Sheriff Forbes: I hope not.

[He sees Vicki bleeding more on the couch.]

Damon: Aw, don't get blood on the couch!
[Walks over.]

Damon: Please? I got you good, didn't I?
[She doesn't answer.]

Damon: Well, you're not gonna be any fun today. I'm so gonna regret this.
[Damon bites his wrist and puts it to her mouth. She struggles but eventually gives in.]

Damon: Drink up. Drink it up. Don't drip. There you go. Good girl. That's it.

[Elena and Stefan are driving through the woods in Elena's car.]

Stefan: Stop here.
Elena: What are we doing here?
[They get out of the car.]

Stefan: I want to show you something.
Elena: In the middle of nowhere?
Stefan: This...Didn't used to be nowhere. Used to be my home.
Elena: It looks so...
Stefan: Old? It's because they are.
Elena: Wait. How long have you...

Stefan: Wait. Where did you learn this game?
Damon: Camp outside Atlanta. One of the officers picked it up at Harvard. Catch.
[Damon throws the ball and Stefan catches it.]

Stefan: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are the rules? What are the rules?
[Stefan and Damon playfully struggle for the ball when Katherine exits the house.]

Katherine: Who needs rules? Mind if I join you?
Stefan: Uh, well, you could, uh...you could get hurt. My brother likes to play rough.
Katherine: Somehow, I think that you play rougher.
[She snatches the ball from Stefan and runs off. Stefan stares a longing stare at Katherine as she runs off.]

Damon: Why are you just standing there? That is a girl who clearly wants to be chased. If you don't do it, I will.
[They both chase after her.]

Damon: What would you like it to be?
Stefan: [smiles] They extended your leave?
Damon: I was simply having too much fun to return to battle.
Stefan: Your commitment to the confederacy is inspiring.
[Stefan walks over and hugs him.]

Katherine: Well, this works out wonderfully for me.
Damon: How's that, miss Katherine?
Katherine: Now I'll have both of you here to keep me entertained. First and foremost, I'll need someone to escort me to the founder's ball.
Damon and Stefan: With pleasure. I would be honored.
Katherine: The smart and kind Salvatore brothers both coming to my rescue. How will I ever choose?
[She walks away.]

Salvatore Estate Ruins
[Elena and Stefan walk about the ruins of the old estate.]

Stefan: She chose me. I escorted her to the ball at the original Lockwood mansion.
Elena: The first founder's party...Where you signed the registry.
Stefan: I didn't care that I had gotten something that my brother wanted. I didn't even care if it hurt him. I only knew that I wanted her.
Elena: So he was upset.
Stefan: That's the thing about Damon. He doesn't get mad. He just gets even.

Elena: So he stole her from you, not the other way around?
Stefan: Turns out she wasn't ours to steal.
Salvatore Estate 1864
[Stefan is with Katherine in her room making out and they almost start making love.]

Stefan: I will love you forever.
Katherine: Forever is a very long time, you know.
Stefan: Not long enough.
[Katherine elongates her fangs and bites him. The next morning, her handmaiden, Birdie, is helping her get dressed when Stefan wakes up.]

Katherine: Good morning. Clear the room, please.
[Birdie leaves.]

Katherine: You're upset.
Stefan: Your face, it was like a demon.
Katherine: But you're not afraid.
Stefan: Get away from me. Get away.
Katherine: [compels him] It doesn't change the way you feel about me. You will not tell anyone.
Stefan: I...
Katherine: Shh. We will go on exactly as we have.
Stefan: Yes. We will go on.
Katherine: You have no idea of the future I have planned for us, Stefan...You, me, and Damon. No rules.
Salvatore Estate Ruins
Stefan: She could control my mind; and Damon's. She compelled each of us to keep the secret from the other. She wanted all of us to be together. Forever. Didn't work out that way, but...Damon and I, looks like we're stuck with each other...Like it or not.
[He pulls out Damon's ring from a ruin.]

Elena: Is that Damon's ring?
Stefan: I took it from him, but I have to give it back.
Elena: No, don't, Stefan. Keep it hidden.
Stefan: Elena, if I don't give it to him, he'll retaliate in the only way that he knows he can hurt me.
Elena: And how is that?
Stefan: By hurting you.
Lockwood House
Sheriff Forbes: We're working on it, Mayor Lockwood.
Mr Lockwood: Doc ID the bodies?
Sheriff Forbes: A few townies. Notorious druggies.
Mr Lockwood: I suppose that'll make it easy for people to buy the story. And Vicki Donovan?
Sheriff Forbes: She's not one of the deceased.
Mr Lockwood: Where the hell is she?
Sheriff Forbes: I wish I knew.
Logan: Sorry I'm late.
Mr Lockwood: You have the watch? It's ready.
Logan: That's it?
Mr Lockwood: Yes. That's it.
[He gives him the vampire compass.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Vicki is dancing.]

Vicki: I am so over Tyler, so over him. I knew from the beginning that I was only a piece of ass to him, but i thought maybe if he got to know me better, he might see something more. But no. Now, Jeremy, on the other hand, that's all he's ever seen in me is something more, and i like that.
Damon: Jeremy, huh? Elena's brother?
Vicki: Yeah, yeah. So, Elena used to date my brother, and they were always together, so Jeremy would always be hanging around and crushing on me and...Hey, why don't you have a girlfriend? You're, like, totally cool and so hot.
Damon: I know.
Vicki: Don't you wanna be in love?
Damon: I've been in love. It's painful and pointless and overrated.
Vicki: Except when it isn't.
Damon: No more talking. Let's dance.
Vicki: My mom spends most of her time in Virginia beach with Pete. He drives trucks. I don't remember my dad, but from what I gather, he's not worth remembering.
Damon: Your life is so pathetic.
Vicki: Yeah. I mean, I'm the screwed-up one. Matt's got it so easy. He's the golden boy. I mean, he's gonna get a football scholarship and marry Elena and have a lawn mower and some babies, and when i think of my future, I just come up blank.
Damon: You are so damaged.
Vicki: Yep.
Damon: I mean, you don't have one hint of self-esteem.
Vicki: Nope, none.
Damon: I think I know what can help you.
Vicki: So what's that?
Damon: Death.
[He kills her. After few minutes, Vicki wakes up, as a vampire.]

Vicki: What happened? We were dancing, and then...
Damon: Then I killed you.
Vicki: What?
Damon: You're dead.
Vicki: I'm dead?
Damon: Yeah, well, let's not make a big deal out of it. You drank my blood, I killed you, and now you have to feed in order to complete the process.
Vicki: You're wasted.
Damon: You don't wanna be out there all alone. You're about to get really freaky.
Vicki: Ok, I had a really good time. I just wanna go home.
Damon: You're gonna start craving blood, and until you get it, you're gonna feel very out of it. You have to be careful.
Vicki: Come on, move.
Damon: See? you're already starting to fall apart.
Vicki: And I'm going home now.
Damon: Ok, fine. I'm just warning you. Actually, you know what? You should go. In fact, if I were you, I would stop by your boyfriend Jeremy's house.
Vicki: Yeah, whatever.
Damon: Bye. Tell Elena I said hi and if you see Stefan, tell him to call me.
Woods
Sheriff Forbes: I got Stanley on the Moore street entrance. The rest of us will cover other access points. Call him or call me if that thing goes off. Don't use the radio. Cellphones only.
Logan: Got it.
Sheriff Forbes: You've got 8 rounds. Remember, wood bullets won't kill him, but it'll wound him enough for you to get close and stake him. You sure you can handle this?
Logan: Of course I can.
Sheriff Forbes: You ever staked a vampire before?
Logan: Have you?
Gilbert Residence
[Doorbell ringing.]

Jeremy: I'm Coming!
Vicki: Hey. The sun is killing me. My eyes are on fire.
Jeremy: Where have you been?
Vicki: It's good. Everything's good.
[They began to kiss.]

Jeremy: Did something happen?
Vicki: I'm hungry. What do you got to eat?
Jeremy: You're high? Vicki, it's the middle of the day.
Vicki: Could you just not talk so loud? My head, it hurts. I need quiet.
Salvatore Estate Ruins
Elena: The mind control...You said Katherine used. Do you ever do that to me?
Stefan: No. That necklace, it contains an herb called vervain. It protects you from being compelled. I wanted to protect you from Damon's influence. But I also wanted to...Protect you from me. Elena, you should never take that necklace off...Because no matter what happens after today, no matter how you feel about me...You'll know that you were free to make your own choice.
Gilbert Residence
Matt: Where is she?
Jeremy: Come this way.
Matt: What's she on?
Jeremy: I...I don't know.
Matt: Hey, Vic. How you doin'?
Vicki: Not good, Mattie. I hurt.
Matt: Ok, where's it hurt?
Vicki: My gums. My jaw hurts. My gum...there's something in my gums, and it hurts.
Matt: Ok, well...
Vicki: No. Just leave me alone.
Matt: Come on, Vic. Don't be like that. Let's get you home.
Vicki: Just turn it off!
Jeremy: Turn what off?
Vicki: The talking, the chatter, just turn it off.
[TV sound is inaudible.]

Man on TV: ...horribly. Three bodies were found dead in what is believed to be a drug deal gone awry. The bodies have yet to be identified. They were discovered earlier today over at the old Mystic Falls cemetery.
Jeremy: That's where we were last night.
Matt: What happened, Vic?
Man on TV: ...homicide, and are fast under way looking for suspects. They're asking anyone with information...
Matt: I'm calling the cops.
Vicki: No. Don't.
Jeremy: What happened after I left last night, Vick?
[Vicki pushes Jeremy.]

Matt: Jer, are you ok ?
Jeremy: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Matt: Damn, Vick.
[Elena and Stefan enter the house.]

Elena: What's going on?
Matt: She's really messed up.
Stefan: Elena, back up. Vicki, look at me. Focus. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Guys, take her up to bed. Shut the blinds. She's gonna be ok. Come on. Come on.
[Matt and Jeremy take Vicki upstairs.]

Elena: You know what's wrong with her?
Stefan: Yeah.
Elena: What is it?
Stefan: She's transitioning.
Elena: Transitioning to what?
Stefan: A vampire.
Elena: What?
Stefan: Damon must have gotten to her. She's new. She hasn't completed her transformation yet.
Elena: H-how does she do that?
Stefan: She has to feed on human blood.
Elena: And what if she doesn't?
Stefan: She'll die. She may only have a few hours.
Elena: She's upstairs with him right now.
Stefan: It's ok. She doesn't know what's happening to her yet.
Elena: So when is she gonna know?
Stefan: Right now, she doesn't remember anything. A part of her is still human, but slowly, the deeper she gets into the transition, the memories will start to come back, and then she'll know she has to make the choice.
Elena: The same choice you made?
[In the bedroom.]

Vicki: I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.
Jeremy: Aw, you just...you need to sleep it off, ok?
[Jeremy hugs her. Her mouth is near his neck and she seems like she's about to bite him, when she gets up and leaves.]

Vicki: No.
Matt: Vick. Vicki!
Jeremy: She was fine, and then she just...she just freaked out.
Matt: I'm gonna go look for her. Call me if you hear anything.
Stefan: I can track her.
Elena: Go.
Woods
[Cellphone rings.]

Sheriff Forbes: Yeah.
Logan: I think I got something. It's pointing towards the old cemetery.
Sheriff Forbes: Headed your way.
Gilbert Residence
Jeremy: Maybe we should check in with Matt.
Elena: He'll call when he finds her.
Jeremy: Well, what are we supposed to do?
Elena: We wait. We're supposed to wait.
Jeremy: I don't know what's wrong with her.
Elena: She'll be fine. It'll all be fine.
[Doorbell rings. It's Damon. Elena tries to shut the door on him but he pushes back.]

Elena: Jeremy, go upstairs.
Damon: You're afraid of me. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess. Stefan finally 'fessed up.
Elena: Stay away from me.
Damon: Hey, there's no need to be rude. I'm just looking for Stefan. May I come in? Oh, wait. Of course I can. I've been invited. We can cut to the chase if you want. I'm not gonna kill you right now. That wouldn't serve my greater agenda. So...Where's Stefan?
Elena: He's out looking for Vicki.
Damon: Don't look at me with those judgey little eyes. Girl's gonna thank me for what I did to her.
Elena: Did you thank Katherine?
Damon: Mmm. Got the whole life story, huh?
Elena: I got enough.
Damon: Oh, I doubt that. Tell my brother I'm looking for him. Oh, tip for later, be careful who you invite in the house.
Cemetery
Stefan: Vicki.
Vicki: I'm starting to remember things, what he is, what he said. I remember you. The hospital, the...the rooftop, it's all coming back.
Stefan: I'm so sorry. Damon had no right to do this to you.
Vicki: He said that I need to feed. What will happen if i don't?
Stefan: You'll fade quickly...And then it'll all just be over.
Vicki: I'll be dead.
Stefan: Hey.
Vicki: I don't want this.
Stefan: I know. It'll be ok. You're gonna be ok. I can help you.
Vicki: Is it better? Is it better? Will I be better? I wanna go home. Will you take me home?
Stefan: Ok.
[Gunshots. Stefan is hurt.]

Stefan: Ahh!
Vicki: No!
[Damon bites Logan and takes the bullet out of Stefan's chest.]

Damon: It's wood. They know. If anyone's gonna kill you, it's gonna be me. My ring.
[Vicki is drinking Logan's blood.]

Stefan: No! No! Vicki!
Vicki: I'm sorry.
Damon: Oops.
[Damon picks up the compass.]

[Sheriff Forbes finds Logan.]

Sheriff Forbes: Oh god...The watch. Find the watch.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena is waiting for Stefan in front of the house.]

Elena: You're bleeding.
Stefan: No, it's ok. It's ok. I'm ok.
Stefan: I couldn't stop her. I tried.
Elena: What does that mean?
Stefan: She fed, and then I lost her.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: I'll take care of it. I'll find her, and I will show her that she can live like I do. I will make sure that she does not hurt anybody, Elena. I promise you.
Elena: What do I tell my brother and...and Matt?
Stefan: We'll come up with a story.
Elena: You mean we'll come up with a lie.
Stefan: I'm so sorry.
Elena: I gave you today just like you asked. And I understand that you would never do anything to hurt me, and I promise I will keep your secret, but...I can't be with you, Stefan. I'm sorry. I...I just can't...
[Elena walks into the house, falls to the floor and cries.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena wakes up and goes into the bathroom.]

Elena: Sorry.
Jeremy: Oh, no, it's cool, I'm done.
Elena: You're up early. Where are you going?
Jeremy: Police station. They're organizing the search party for Vicki, so...
Elena: Wait. Shouldn't you be going to school?
Jeremy: What? You're kidding me, right?
Elena: You shouldn't skip school. If they find her, we'll know. That's what cellphones are for.
Jeremy: Yeah, your lips keep movin'. I don't know why.
Mystic Falls High
[Matt's phone rings.]

Matt: Yeah?
Vicki: Matty?
Matt: Vicki, where are you? Are you okay?
Vicki: Yeah. I'm okay.
Matt: Tell me where you are, and I'll come get you.
Vicki: No. Matty, I just need some time to figure things out. Just know that I am okay, okay? Please don't worry about me.
[She hangs up on him.]

Salvatore Boarding House
Vicki: I don't understand why I have to stay cooped up here. Why can't I just go home?
Stefan: Because you're changing, Vicki, and it's not something you wanna do alone.
Damon: There's nothin' about that Logan guy I killed in here. Not a word. Someone's covering it up.
Vicki: What is that?
Damon: This is a very special, very old compass. What was Logan Fell doing with it? Aren't you curious?
Stefan: Well, if you're so worried that somebody's onto you, why don't you just leave town, Damon?
Damon: We should all be worried.
Vicki: Hey, um, I'm hungry. Do you have anything to eat?
Stefan: Here.
[Stefan hands her a cup.]

Vicki: What is it?
Stefan: It's what you're craving.
Damon: Heh. Don't lie to the girl. It's so not what you're craving, but it'll do in a pinch, right, Stef?
Vicki: What is it?
Damon: Yeah, what is it? Is it a skunk? Saint Bernard? Bambi?
Stefan: Go on. Give it a try.
Damon: She's new. She needs people blood. She can't sustain on that stuff.
Vicki: Yeah, why can't I have people blood?
Damon: Yeah.
Stefan: Because it's wrong to pray on innocent people, Vicki.
Damon: You don't have to kill to feed. Just find someone really tasty and then erase their memory after wards. It's so easy.
Stefan: No, no, no. There's no guarantee that you can control yourself, okay? It takes years to learn that. You could easily kill somebody, and then you have to carry that with you for the rest of your life, which, if I haven't made clear, is eternity.
Damon: Don't listen to him. He walks on a moral plane way out of our eye line. I say snatch, eat, erase.
Stefan: Hey, look at me. We choose our own path. Our values and our actions, they define who we are.
Damon: Okay, count deepak. I am outta here.
Vicki: Can I have some more?
[Damon goes downstairs, the door bell rings. Damon answers it, Elena is there.]

Elena: Is Stefan here?
Damon: Yep!
Elena: Where is he?
Damon: And good morning to you, little miss  I'm on a mission.
Elena: How can you be so arrogant and glib after everything that you've done?
Damon: And how can you be so brave and stupid to call a vampire arrogant and glib?
Elena: If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
Damon: Yes, you would.
Elena: But I'm not.
Damon: Yet.
Elena: Where is Stefan?
Damon: He's upstairs singing The rain in Spain. Knock yourself out.
[Damon leaves. Elena closes the door and walks down the hall.]

Elena: Stefan? Stefan?
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: Where is Vicki?
Stefan: She's upstairs.
Elena: What happens now? Because my brother is out there searching for her with the rest of the town. What do I tell him?
Stefan: I'm working with her, but it's gonna take time. She's a very volatile and impulsive personality. She's a drug user. I mean, all that's gonna play a part in how she responds to this.
Elena: So, she's a vampire with issues? What am I supposed to do? Because I'm lying to everyone that I care about. What's gonna happen to her?
Stefan: I'm gonna keep her here with me until I know that she's safe.
Vicki: How long is that?
Stefan: We can talk about that later.
Elena: Hey, Vicki, How are you?
Vicki: How am I? You're kidding, right?
Gram's Residence
Bonnie: Was our family burned in the witch trials?
Grams: No, the girls that were persecuted in Salem were entirely innocent. You have to have more than ignorance to trap a real witch.
Bonnie: How did we end up in Mystic Falls?
Grams: Our family fled Salem in 1692 and relocated here. Our ancestors lived in secrecy for over a hundred years. It's important that we still do.
Bonnie: Grams, everybody knows you're a witch.
Grams: They also know it's absurd, can't be true. I'm just a kooky lady that teaches occult at the university. No ones really believes. They just poke fun. And let 'em. Don't let 'em know the truth.
Bonnie: Where's the witchcraft? I mean, you've been talking history for 2 days. I wanna get to the fun part.
Grams: It's not meant to be fun. It's real and it's serious, and you must understand it before you practice it. Aren't you late for school?
Mystic Grill
[Mayor Lockwood and Mrs. Lockwood are sitting at a booth.]

Mr Lockwood: We never should have trusted that Logan...weasel with the watch.
Mrs Lockwood: How many are we dealing with?
Mr Lockwood: Well, the coroner thinks one. Something about the wound radius and the jaw pattern.
Mrs Lockwood: Are we in danger? I mean, if it found the watch, then it knows we know, and could it come after us? A-and should I even be saying it? Or...or is it a he or a she?
Mr Lockwood: If it has any historical knowledge of the town, then it'll know where the watch came from, so yes, we could very much be in danger.
Mrs Lockwood: So what do we do?
Mr Lockwood: Just keep it quiet. We can't have the entire town aware of this. We need to find it before it finds us.
[Damon has been listening in to their conversation.]

Mystic Falls High
Tyler: Hey man!
Matt: Hey!
Tyler: I heard they're putting together a search party for Vicki.
Matt: She just called. She's okay.
Tyler: Ooh good. That's great. I figured you must have been goin' out of your mind.
Matt: Little bit. Yeah.
Tyler: I was just gonna offer. You know, if there's anything I could do.
Matt: I appreciate it.
Caroline: I have got your costume. It's all here.
Bonnie: Seriously?
Caroline: Come on. Can someone please be excited that it's Halloween? I just wanna have fun, you know, just some silly, fluffy, Damon free fun.
Bonnie: Hey, isn't this the one you got from Damon?
Caroline: Yep. Wear it. Toss it. I don't care. I just want it gone. Hey, have you seen Elena? Do we know what she's wearing?
Bonnie: I was with Grams all weekend. I haven't talked to her. Maybe she's with Stefan.
Caroline: Riding to his castle on his white horse.
Bonnie: Don't be bitter. It provokes wrinkles.
Salvatore Boarding House
Stefan: Coffee is our friend. It's the caffeine. It circulate through our veins, and it warms our body so we're not so cold to the touch.
Vicki: Well, what if I wanna drink human blood?
Stefan: You're gonna have to learn to live with that urge and fight it on a daily basis one day at time.
Vicki: Oh god! Don't start with that whole 12 steps thing. School counselor has been down that road, and it doesn't work for me.
Stefan: It can work. It's your choice, Vicki.
Vicki: So you've never tasted human blood?
Stefan: Not in a long time.
Vicki: How long?
Stefan: Years and years. I'm not proud of my past behavior.
Vicki: Does this sketchy feeling ever go away? It's like I have a massive hangover. This daylight thing is a bitch. I need more blood. Where's your bathroom? I have to pee. Why do I have to pee? I thought I was dead.
[Vicki leaves the room.]

Stefan: I'm going to, uh...I'm gonna get her some more. All right. I'll be quick.
[Stefan leaves. Vicki re-enters.]

Vicki: False alarm. My body's feeling really funky. It's a good funk, but it's weird.
Elena: Hmm, who are you calling?
Vicki: Jeremy.
Elena: Vicki, you can't see Jeremy anymore.
Vicki: Oh come on don't you start. I'm gonna see whoever I wanna see.
Elena: Even though you could hurt him?
Vicki: I would never hurt Jeremy.
Elena: I know you think that but I can't take that risk. You're gonna have to let Jeremy go now.
Vicki: Oh really? And how long have you been preparing the you're not good enough speech? I'm assuming it predates the whole vampire thing.
Elena: All I am saying is Jeremy is not getting involved in any of this. I mean it, Vicki.
Vicki: Or what? [Vicki grabs Elena by the throat and pushes her against the wall.]
Vicki: Let's get one thing straight, you perky little bitch. You had my brother whipped for fifteen years. Fifteen years and then you dumped him. When I look at you that is all I see, just so you know. And I'm gonna see Jeremy whenever I wanna see Jeremy, because I have some fun new toys to play with, and I won't think twice about ripping your little head off. You got it?
[Vicki let's her go. Elena is coughing.]

[Later.]

Elena: She threatened me.
Stefan: She's on edge. Imagine every sense in your body operating at super speed. I mean, she's uncomfortable in her own skin. And then when you throw in her other issues...
Elena: How long before it settles? Hours? Days? Weeks?
Stefan: There's no rule book.
Elena: Well, how long before you learned to control it?
Stefan: A while, But I didn't have anybody helping me. I had to do it on my own. The thing is it's hard to resist certain people especially when you're new, it's difficult to separate your feelings. Love, lust, anger, desire...it can all blur into one urge, hunger.
Elena: What does that mean?
Stefan: It means that Jeremy can't see her, not now. She might not be able to resist him, and she could hurt him.
Elena: Or worse.
Stefan: I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.
Elena: I need to get going.
Stefan: Elena...
Elena: Please Stefan. There's only so much I can take.
[Damon enters Stefan's bedroom. Vicki is laying on Stefan's bed, listening to music.]

Damon: What are you doing?
Vicki: Just contemplating the next hundred years. Why did you do it?
Damon: I was...bored.
Vicki: You did this to me out of boredom?
Damon: It's one of the pitfalls of eternity.
Vicki: Now I'm bored. And all I can think about is blood. I just want some blood. I can't think about anything else. What is that about?
Damon: That'll ease up. You've just been cooped up all day. Let's go.
Vicki: Where?
Damon: Your life was pathetic. Your afterlife doesn't have to be.
Stefan: What are you doing?
Damon: She's been cooped up in your room all day. She's not Anne Frank.
Stefan: No no. Hey hey...Now's not the time for this.
Damon: If you're gonna teach her. Teach her. Show her what it's all about.
Stefan: She could hurt someone.
Damon: I'm not takin' her to Disneyland. We're going in the front yard. Come on.
Stefan: Bad idea Damon.
Damon: She's a vampire Stefan, she should know the perks.
Vicki: Like what?
Damon: Like....
[Damon uses his superspeed and goes behind her.]

Vicki: Whoa. How did you do that? Ho ho ho ho.
Damon: Come on Vicki, live a little. No pun intended.
[Vicki uses her superspeed and runs away.]

Damon: Uh...my bad.
Donovan Residence
[Vicki goes to her home. She tries to get inside but can't.]

Vicki: Matt?
Matt: Vicki? Is that you?
Vicki: Hey.
Matt: Get in here.
[He embraces her and she smells the blood running through his veins, she pulls away.]

Vicki: In a minute. I...
Matt: Please come inside. I've been worried. Thank God you're okay. Where were you, Vic?
Vicki: It's no big deal. Drop it already.
Matt: Three people were murdered in the woods. The cops were lookin' for you. They wanna question you.
Vicki: They know where I live.
Matt: Everyone was worried about you.
Vicki: I'm back now. Just let it go.
Matt: Are you kidding? I had a freakin' search party out lookin' for you while you were off on your crazy drug trip, and you want me to let it go?
Vicki: My head hurts.
Matt: You think?
[The door bell rings. Matt answers it. Stefan's outside.]

Matt: Stefan, what are you doing here?
Stefan: Is Vicki home?
Matt: Yeah.
Stefan: Can I see her, please?
Vicki: Don't let him in. I don't want him in here.
Matt: Did he do something to you?
Vicki: No, I just don't want him in here.
Stefan: Just let me come in so I can explain myself.
Matt: Look, I don't know what's going on but I think you should leave now.
Stefan: Matt...
Matt: Please, now, Stefan.
Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is calling Vicki.]

Jeremy: You gotta call me, Vic. I don't get it. What's going on with you? Just...just call me please.
Elena: Hey. So, um, do you wanna hang out tonight? We could go to the, uh, Halloween thing at school. Could be fun!
Jeremy: Cool. Sure. Sounds uh...sounds fun. Can't wait.
Elena: I know you're upset about Vicki. I heard she called Matt. But you can't be with her. She needs to get better. The best thing you can do for her is let her go.
Jeremy: What does that even mean, let her go? Oh, okay, sure. Since we're such experts on letting people go, right?
Elena: I know you may not see it, but trust me Jer. It's for the best.
Jeremy: Look, for months after mom and dad died, I felt like crap, like nothing really even mattered crap. Now all of a sudden, I get these moments and things started to feel just a little bit better, and Vicki was in every single of 'em. So you may not see it, but trust me. Keeping me away from her is not for the best.
[Vicki and Jeremy exchange texts. They plan on meeting up at the school carnival.]

Mystic Falls High
[The Halloween carnival is going on.]

Tyler: Cider for the ladies. It's a Lockwood special.
Bonnie: No way. Last year I was hung over until Thanksgiving.
Caroline: Lightweight. I am going to drink until someone is hot enough to make out with.
Tyler: Sounds like a plan.
Mystic Grill
[Mrs. Lockwood and Mayor Lockwood are sitting down]

Mr Lockwood: How many martinis have you had?
Mrs Lockwood: Oh. Don't start with me.
Mr Lockwood: Can we go now? We're late for the Halloween party. Let's go.
Mrs Lockwood: So go ahead. I'd like to finish my drink.
Damon: Let me guess. Daisy Buchanan. I love a good gatsby look.
Mrs Lockwood: I've met you before. Aren't you Caroline Forbes' boyfriend?
Damon: Ah, she had a schoolgirl crush on me but...It was cute but I had to let her down easy.
Mrs Lockwood: It's Damon, right?
Damon: Ah, you remember?
Mrs Lockwood: Well, you have a face that's hard to forget. What's your last name Damon?
Damon: Salvatore.
Mrs Lockwood: Salvatore.
Damon: Mm hmm.
Mrs Lockwood: Are you any relation to Zach?
Damon: Zach's my uncle. How do you know Zach?
[Damon tries to use compulsion on her.]

Mrs Lockwood: Are you okay?
Damon: Yeah. I think there's something in my eye.
Mrs Lockwood: Well, I know Zach from the Founder's Council. You know the Salvatores were one of this town's original settlers.
Damon: Yes, they were. I wasn't aware that Zach was a member. I just recently moved back home and haven't really had a chance to meet many of his friends.
Mrs Lockwood: Well, will you tell him to return my calls? I've left several messages.
Damon: Zach went out of town for a bit. But if it's about the Vervain...
Mrs Lockwood: You know about the Vervain?
Damon: Well, I'm a Salvatore. Of course I do.
Mrs Lockwood: Of course.
Damon: Hmm. Cheers.
Mystic Falls High
[Elena and Jeremy arrive. Jeremy scares some kids. Elena smacks him.]

Kids: Aah aah!
Matt: You went with last year's costume too, huh?
Elena: Yeah. I didn't know that I was coming till an hour ago.
Matt: Me neither. And you're going as...you?
Elena: He's not talking to me right now. We got into fight.
Matt: Yeah, I got into it with Vic too, when she got home. I'm trying not to smother her tonight, but part of me didn't wanna let her out of my sight.
Elena: She's here?
Matt: Yeah, you can't miss her. She's a vampire.
Elena: Where did Jeremy go?
Matt: Elena what's the matter?
Elena: I..I've gotta find him.
[Vicki is walking through the halls. Stefan grabs her and pulls her into a classroom.]

Vicki: What, you're following me now?
Stefan: You didn't really give me a much of choice.
Vicki: Let me out of here.
Stefan: You shouldn't be here Vicki. Crowds like this, it make it even harder for you to keep yourself under control.
Vicki: I'm fine.
Stefan: Really?
Vicki: Mmm hmm.
Stefan: No headache? Your stomach's not screaming at you? You're not feeling lightheaded or anxious or cranky like if someone looks at you the wrong way you could just rip their head off? Do you wanna know what that's called? It's called hunger and it's only gonna get worse and worse every minute that you pretend like it's not controlling you.
Mystic Grill
Damon: So you need vervain?
Mrs Lockwood: Yes. my husband and I only have left what his parents left him, And Zach had promised that he could supply us with more.
Damon: Well, I talk to him all the time. So why don't I just ask him?
Mrs Lockwood: Hmm.
Damon: Mmm. How much do you need? I mean, how many people, you think?
Mrs Lockwood: Well, there's our children, of course.
Damon: Of course.
Mrs Lockwood: And, um, friends, family, and everyone on the council.
Damon: The council?
Mrs Lockwood: Zach knows how many. But I am so late. My husband is not going to be happy with me.
Damon: Well, are you happy with your husband?
Mrs Lockwood: You're flirting with me.
Damon: You flirted with me first.
Mrs Lockwood: True.
Damon: Let me escort you to the school. It's not safe out there alone. I mean, I've seen 10 vampires tonight.
Mrs Lockwood: Heh. well, if only the real ones were as easy to find.
Damon: How's that search goin'?
Mrs Lockwood: Oh, we had the founder's party, and anyone who arrived during the day was eliminated as a suspect.
Damon: Oh.
Mrs Lockwood: And all the rest were just dead ends, so mmm mmm, I gotta go.
Damon: Okay.

Elena: I lost track of Jeremy. I was worried.
Matt: What's goin' on?
Stefan: Hey. uh, everything's fine.
Vicki: I told you to quit bothering me.
Elena: No. Vicki, don't do this.
Vicki: Matt, he won't leave me alone.
Matt: You need to back off, man.
Elena: Matt, it's...it's okay.
Matt: No, it's not okay. What the hell is your problem?
Elena: Stefan. She's gone.
Stefan: I'm trying to help her.
[Jeremy is walking around. Vicki grabs him and pulls him into her]

Jeremy: Whoa. Vic, you scared the hell out of me.
Vicki: Sorry. I'm sorry.
[They kiss and run away.]

[Damon is talking to Bonnie.]

Damon: So where...where'd Caroline run off to?
Bonnie: Do yourself a favor, Damon, and don't ask me about Caroline.
Damon: Oh, Bonnie. So loyal.
Bonnie: Just stay away from her.
[Damon notices the crystal.]

Damon: Where'd you get that?
Bonnie: From a friend.
Damon: Caroline. You know that's mine, don't you?
Bonnie: Not anymore.
Damon: Funny. I'd like it back, please.
Bonnie: I'm not giving it to you. I'll give it to Caroline, and she can give it to you if she feels like it.
Damon: Or I could just take it right now.
[Damon grabs at the crystal and it burns his hand. Bonnie runs.]

[Elena is still searching for Jeremy. Vicki and Jeremy go out the back entrance and continue kissing. Stefan is trying to pick up on Vicki.]

Elena: Jeremy.
Jeremy: I was so worried about you.
Vicki: I'm fine now, but...I gotta leave.
Jeremy: Wh...what? Where?
Vicki: I gotta get out of here, Jer. I just...I can't live at home with Matt. He just doesn't get it.
Jeremy: No, you can't. You can't just leave.
Vicki: Come with me. If you come with me, we can be together forever.
[They kiss. Vicki bites his lip and starts sucking his blood.]

Jeremy: Okay. Yeah. Ow. You're taking that costume a little too far. What? What is it? Vicki! Vicki, what the hell?! Oh, my god. No! stop! Vicki! No! Ah!
[Elena runs out the back entrance. She sees Vicki attacking Jeremy and runs over to them.]

Elena: Vicki, no!
[Elena hits her with a wooden plank. Vicki grabs her and throws her into a pile of garbage nearby. Stefan grabs Vicki and holds her against the bus.]

Jeremy: Vicki!
[Vicki disappears.]

Stefan: Go. get inside. Go!
[Elena grabs Jeremy and runs. Stefan continues searching for Vicki.]

Elena: Ah!!
[Vicki pushes Jeremy out of the way and grabs Elena. She bites Elena. Stefan stabs Vicki with a wooden stake. Vicki dies.]

Jeremy: Vicki! Vicki! Vicki! Vicki!
[Stefan holds Jeremy back.]

Elena: Get him out of here.
[Stefan calls Damon.]

Damon: What?
Stefan: I Need your help.
[Elena sits down next to Vicki's body.]

Gram's Residence
Grams: What happened to you?
Bonnie: I did something. I don't know. It came from my necklace.
Grams: Where'd you get that?
Bonnie: It's part of my costume. It's a piece of junk.
Grams: That piece of junk belonged to one of the most powerful witches of our family. Let me show you. There she is. Emily Bennett. Your great-great-great-great-grandmother. And there's your necklace.
Mystic Falls High
[Damon arrives. Elena is crying.]

Damon: You should go. I got this.
Elena: You did this. This is your fault.
Damon: You confuse me for someone with remorse.
[Elena tries to hit Damon but he grabs her hand and stops her.]

Damon: None of this matters to me. None of it.
Elena: People die around you. How could it not matter? It matters, and you know it.
[She hits him.]

Damon: You need to leave. Your wounds are bleeding and you need to leave.
[Elena leaves.]

Matt: Elena! Hey, have you seen...Whoa. wh...what happened?
Elena: Nothing. some idiot with some fake blood got me. I'm gonna go home and shower.
Matt: I...I can't find Vicki. She totally bailed on me.
Elena: I don't know where she is.
Matt: Is this what I'm in for, a lifetime of worrying about her?
Elena: You're a good brother, Matt.
Matt: Yeah, Maybe she went home.
Elena: Maybe.
Matt: Okay.
[Elena gets in her car and cries.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena arrives home. Stefan is waiting outside.]

Elena: Where is he?
Stefan: Inside.
[She goes inside and goes over to Jeremy.]

Elena: Do you understand what happened tonight?
Jeremy: No. I don't understand. I mean, I know what I saw, but...I don't understand.
Elena: She was going to kill me.
Jeremy: Now she's dead. Vicki's dead.
Elena: I'm so sorry, Jer.
Jeremy: Make it stop. It hurts.
Elena: Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. it's okay.
Jeremy: Why does everybody have to die on me?
Elena: Oh, my god. come here.
[Elena holds Jeremy.]

[Outside, Stefan's sitting on the porch. Elena comes out.]

Elena: Are you okay?
Stefan: I, uh...I wanted to help her. But instead, uh...How's he doin'?
Elena: He's a mess. I don't want him going through this again. He's just a kid.
Stefan: Elena, what can I do? I...What can I do to help? I'll do anything.
Elena: Can you make him forget?
Stefan: Elena...
Elena: Stefan, please. I don't know how he'll ever get past this. I just want him to forget everything that happened.
Stefan: If I did it, there's no guarantee that it would work...Because of who I am. Because of how I live. I don't have the ability to do it right.
Damon: I can do it. If this is what you want...I'll do it.
Elena: It's what I want.
Damon: What do you want him to know?
Elena: I want you to tell him that Vicki left town and she's not coming back. That he shouldn't look for her or worry about her. He's gonna miss her, but he knows it's for the best.
[Damon goes inside. Elena sits down next to Stefan.]

Elena: Part of me wishes that I could forget, too...Forget meeting you, finding out what you are and everything that's happened since.
Stefan: Is that what you want?
Elena: Yes, it is. Because I don't want it to be like this. I don't wanna feel like this. But I can't. With everything that's happened...I can't lose the way I feel about you.
[Damon comes back out.]

Damon: It's done.
[Elena walks back inside. Damon and Stefan look at each other.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is asleep in the living room. He wakes up when his book falls from his lap to the floor. He is then aroused by a noise in the house.]

Stefan: Damon?
[He gets up and looks around. He hears further disturbance before he is attacked by a vampire.]

Stefan: Lexi!?
Lexi: Hi.
Stefan: What are you doing here?
Lexi: [hugs him] How could you even ask that?
Stefan: I missed you.
Lexi: Happy Birthday.
[Stefan and Lexi are kidding in Stefan's room.]

Lexi: Stop. I don't know, some freak shot at me with wooden bullets. I bail in under sixty. And why is a news reporter hunting vampires?
Stefan: I don't know who knows about us. That guy did. There could be others. Do me a favor, while you're here, please be careful.
Lexi: Why stay? I'm headed to New York for the weekend. Bon Jovi in the Garden. Wanted dead or alive, it's our theme song. It'll be a blast.
Stefan: Do you think he would actually remember us? That was a pretty crazy weekend huh?
Lexi: We can make him remember us. Come on! Let's go. I mean, what's keeping you here?
Stefan: I told you, her name is Elena.
Lexi: Let's hope she's better than the last girl you got all sprung over. [holds up a photo of Katherine.]
Stefan: [takes the photo away] You didn't even know Katherine.
Lexi: 'Cause if I did I'd kick her ass. Little bitch. Speaking of...where's Damon?
Stefan: Inflicting misery somewhere. You gonna be okay here alone? 'Cause I got some things I gotta take care of.
Lexi: It's not exactly like I can go anywhere. And you and Damon are the only ones with these nifty little daylight rings. I have a mood ring from '75! Trade ya?
Stefan: Doesn't work that way and you know it.
Lexi: Yeah.
Stefan: Hey Lex. I'm really glad that you came here.
Lexi: What are we doing for your birthday? It's not everyday a guy turns a hundred and sixty-two years old.
Stefan: [groans] Really?
Lexi: Oh yeah.

Sheriff's Office
[Sheriff Forbes is questioning Elena, Stefan, Matt and Jeremy over Vicki's disappearance.]

Sheriff Forbes: Where did Vicki say she was going?
Jeremy: She didn't.
Sheriff Forbes: Did she tell her brother where she was going?
Matt: No she didn't say anything to me. She told Jeremy to tell me that she was leaving town.
Sheriff Forbes: Is there anyone I can talk to that may know what happened to her prior to her leaving town?
Matt: Stefan Salvatore may know. He came by the house to see her but she wouldn't talk to him.
Sheriff Forbes: What was he doing there?
Stefan: I was trying to help her, I knew that Elena was worried about her brother, he was dating Vicki and she had a drug problems, so I tried to help.
Sheriff Forbes: So you got involved because Elena asked you to?
Elena: I asked Stefan to help. I thought that, by helping Vicki, he was helping my brother.
Sheriff Forbes: What was her behavior like those last few days before she left?
Matt: Up and down, very sketchy, like she was coming down from some major partying.
Sheriff Forbes: Any signs of aggression or violence?
Jeremy: None that I remember.
Stefan: No.
Elena: No.
Sheriff Forbes: So you believe Vicki really has left town?
Matt: Yes.
Stefan: Yes.
Elena: Yes.
Jeremy: I'll miss her but....I think it's for the best.
[Stefan is waiting in front of the sheriff's office for Elena. Matt exits the building and walks past Stefan.]

Stefan: I was trying to help her Matt. That's all.
[Matt leaves. Elena finally comes out.]

Elena: [to Jenna and Jeremy] I'll meet you guys at the car.
Jenna: Ok. [leaves with Jeremy]
Stefan: You okay?
Elena: I don't think the Sheriff suspected anything. Jeremy had no memory at all. All he knew was what Damon made him know.
Stefan: Thank you.
Elena: I can't do this Stefan. Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy, all I think is that Vicki is never gonna come back. And they'll never know why. Around you people get hurt and people die. I can't I just...it's just too much....
Stefan: Why don't we go somewhere and talk about it.
Elena: No, Stefan you have to stay away from me.
Salvatore Boarding House
[In Stefan's room Lexi is sleeping Damon awakes her.]

Lexi: [shifts around on the pillow] Hmmm, Huh.
[She turns to find Damon next to her.]

Damon: Boo.
Lexi: [groans]
Damon: Hello Lexi. What an unexpected surprise.
Lexi: Unexpected surprise? I think the wrong brother went back to high school.
Damon: How long are you here for?
Lexi: Just for Stefan's B-Day.
Damon: Oh, you mean you didn't come all this way to see me?
Lexi: [snorts] That's it Damon. After a century I finally realize death means nothing without you. Do me.
Damon: Why are you so mean to me?
Lexi: Uh, have you met you? You're not a nice person.
Damon: Because I'm a vampire.
Lexi: But you're only the bad parts.
Damon: Teach me to be good.
[Damon leans in but Lexi grabs him firmly by the neck, choking him.]

Lexi: I'm older and that means stronger.
Damon: [wheezes] Sorry.
Lexi: Don't ruin my time with Stefan, 'cause I'll hurt you. And you know I can do it.
Damon: Yeah.
[Lexi releases him and leaves.]

Gram's Residence
[Bonnie is packing her suitcase.]

Grams: You leavin'?
Bonnie: Dad doesn't like it when I stay here too much.
Grams: Because he misses you or because he doesn't trust me. Your father's problem is he lacks imagination. He thinks I fill your head with my witchy juju.
Bonnie: He's right.
Grams: He's always right, that's his other problem. [indicates to the crystal necklace] Uh-uh. You need to be wearing that.
Bonnie: I gotta give it back to Caroline. It doesn't belong to me.
Grams: Yes, it does. It was your ancestor's and now it's yours.
Bonnie: Emily was your ancestor too, why don't you wear it?
Grams: Because it didn't find me, it found you, protected you. A witch's talisman is a powerful tool, don't be givin' that back to anybody.
Bonnie: I just wish it was prettier.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena is sitting on the couch. Jenna comes and sits next to her. Jeremy is writing something behind them.]

Jenna: You're wallowing.
Elena: So are you.
Jenna: My wallow is legitimate. I was dumped.
Elena: Yeah. Well Logan's a jerk.
Jenna: You didn't get a brush-off e-mail say: I'm leaving town. See ya.
Jeremy: Wanna keep it down over there?
Jenna: Why? What are you doing?
Jeremy: Homework.
Elena: Since when do you do homework?
Jeremy: I gotta finish this. I'm way behind and I have a quiz tomorrow so...
[Elena and Jenna share surprised glances.]

Elena: What do you think? Alien?
Jenna: Some sort of replicant.
Jeremy: He can hear you.
Sheriff's Office
[Sheriff Forbes is dealing with paperwork and receives a call.]

Sheriff Forbes: Yeah. Send him in. [Damon enters the office] Mister Salvatore, come on in. Could you get the door for me?
Damon: Sure.
Sheriff Forbes: I understand from Mrs. Lockwood that your uncle is out the town.
Damon: Yes he is. But I spoke with Zach. He filled me in and asked if I could bring this to you.
[Damon hands the sheriff the box filled with vervain.]

Sheriff Forbes: Vervain.
Damon: That's all we have at the moment, I hope it's enough.
Sheriff Forbes: It's a small circle...Founding families, a few city officials.
Damon: And your deputies, of course right? Are we any closer?
Sheriff Forbes: I think our facts are wrong. We've always believed that vampires can only come out in the dark. What if that's changed?
Damon: So is that even possible?
Sheriff Forbes: We've exhausted every other option. We have to consider the vampire may be walking around during the day. Right in front of us.
Damon: Hm. So what's the next step?
Sheriff Forbes: We're now looking at anyone new to town, since the deaths began. Should turn up a suspect or two.
Damon: And I, of course, will do anything I can to help.
Gilbert Residence
[Bonnie enters Elena's room. Elena is lying down in her bed.]

Bonnie: You up?
Elena: No. [Bonnie walks over and tries to pull the covers off Elena's head] No, no!
Bonnie: Why haven't you called me back?
Elena: I'm sorry.
Bonnie: Are you gonna stay in there forever?
Elena: Yep.
Bonnie: Move over. [lies next to Elena] I'm officially worried. What's going on?
Elena: I'm tired of thinking...of talking I...
Bonnie: Can I get a one-line version so I can at least pretend to be helpful?
Elena: Stefan and I broke up.
Bonnie: I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Right stupid question. I know I've been kind of MIA when you need me the most. I suck.
Elena: You wanna make it up to me. Get my mind off of it.
Bonnie: Just remember you asked for it.
[Bonnie closes the window and grabs one of Elena's pillows. She rips it and empties it of the feathers.]

Elena: Hey!
Bonnie: Be patient.
Elena: OK.
Bonnie: I need to swear you to secrecy.
Elena: It's kind of a bad week for that kind of stuff.
Bonnie: Swear, 'cause I'm not supposed to be showing you this.
Elena: OK, I swear.
Bonnie: There's no windows open, right?
Elena: Right.
Bonnie: There's no fan. No air conditioning.
Elena: None. What are you doing?
Bonnie: Grams just showed me this. You're gonna love it. You ready?
Elena: Bonnie what's going on?
[Bonnie levitates a feather in front of Elena. Then she levitates several more. Elena watches on with shock and amazement.]

Bonnie: It's true Elena. Everything my Grams told me. It's impossible and it's true. I'm a witch.
Elena: I believe you.
Mystic Grill
[Caroline meets Damon on the street outside the grill.]

Caroline: Look dungeon boy I'm done being your little slave girl. You seriously hurt me, and I will be damned if you think.. [Damon uses his compulsion on her] Oh my god where have you been? It's really good to see you.
Damon: Much better. You wanna throw a party here at the grill tonight.
Caroline: Oh, why don't you do it?
Damon: Because then Stefan and his BFF won't come. I need a lot of people. Big crowd. Invite everyone.
Caroline: And why am I having this party?
Damon: Because you're gonna help me solve this town's little vampire problem. And I want my crystal back.
Caroline: But Bonnie has it.
Damon: I know that. Get it from her.
Salvatore Boarding House
Lexi: So this Elena girl. She'll come around. I'm sure of it. Have you had sex yet?
Stefan: No
Lexi: Sex always works. I mean you'll rock her world so hard with your vamp sex, she'll be yours forever.
Stefan: Yeah, but see, this isn't about sex or...or compulsion or any of our other tricks. She has to want to be with me on her own terms.
Lexi: Wow. That sounded all mature and grown-up.
Stefan: I'm not getting any older.
[Lexi opens her suitcase, picks up a blood bag and takes a sip.]

Lexi: Want some?
Stefan: No. Thank you.
Lexi: Relax I didn't kill anyone for it. This phlebotomist I went out with a few times, he's my supplier. [sees Stefan's expression] Oh don't judge, ok? Listen I tried the animal diet; lasted three weeks.
Stefan: It doesn't matter. Cause if I started again...I just don't know if...
Lexi: You could stop.
Stefan: Lexi, I'd never judge you.
Lexi: I'm just jealous of your restraint. I have none. I delight in hedonism. Speaking of which, what are we doing tonight?
[Damon enters the room]

Damon: Funny you should ask.
Lexi: Well I wasn't asking you.
Damon: There's a party at the grill. You'll love it. Banquettes, Tacky wait staff, All of Stefan's friends.
Stefan: Yeah, I don't want a Birthday party.
Damon: Well, It's not for you. It's a party party. No one's gonna know it's your birthday. Caroline's throwing it.
Stefan: Damon, stay away from Caroline.
Damon: We're friends it's cool. It's important for the town to see us out and about like normal folk. We need to blend. [He looks at Lexi's stock of blood]. I prefer mine at 98.6. [leaves]
Lexi: Let's Go. [sees Stefan's expression] Please?
Gilbert Residence
Bonnie: It's Weird huh? After all This times joking about being psychic. I really am a witch. You don't think I'm a freak now, do you?
Elena: No of course not. Bonnie I just...don't understand though. If your Grams asked you to keep all this a secret, why did you tell me?
Bonnie: You're my best friend. I can't keep secrets from you.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Lexi is getting out of a shower.]

Lexi: I'm almost ready.
Stefan: I can't believe you actually think that we should go to this thing.
Lexi: It's not like I'm asking you to run outside midday without your ring. I mean, seriously, it's a party.
Stefan: A party that Damon wants us to go to, you know? So my question is why? I think he's up to something.
Lexi: Who cares? What can he possibly of all those people in a public place?
Stefan: He knows how to keep a low profile, believe me.
Lexi: Okay so he'll behave. Come on. One day a year I get you, one day that you're not brooding and existing in your own head.
Stefan: It's my birthday, yeah?
Lexi: It's my day. And that guy that jump naked in the Trevi fountain and got drunk on the torch of the statue of Liberty, that guy can take a break from all of his worrying for one night and go to a stupid party. So quit your whining [hits his butt] and go get ready.
Stefan: [claps hands together] Fine.
[Elena drives up to the Salvatore Boarding House. She knocks on the door.]

Lexi: It's open! Come on in.
[Elena enters the house and sees Lexi in a towel.]

Lexi: [sees her and recognizes her as Katherine] Oh my God! How...uh- wh-...Who?
Elena: I'm Elena. Who are you?
Lexi: Lexi, a friend of Stefan's.
Elena: Is he here?
Lexi: He's in the shower. Do you want to wait?
Elena: No.
Lexi: I'll tell him you stopped by.
Elena: That's okay. [leaves in shock]
[Lexi goes to Stefan's Bedroom, she seems furious.]

Lexi: Are you out of your freaking mind?
Stefan: What are you talking about?
Lexi: I just met Elena [holds up Stefan's photo of Katherine]. You have some serious explaining to do.
[After Lexi gets dressed and she starts applying her make-up, she talks with Stefan.]

Lexi: You have some serious emotional damage.
Stefan: No, it's not what you think. She's not Katherine.
Lexi: Then they're related, 'cause they can be twins.
Stefan: I don't know.
Lexi: You don't know or you didn't find out?
Stefan: No. Maybe. I don't want to know. I have no desire to tie Elena to Katherine. [sees Lexi's expression] Ok yes, yes the resemblance is what drew me in. But that's it. Katherine and Elena may look the same on the outside but on the inside they are completely different.
Lexi: So Elena is not a raging Bitch then, huh?
Stefan: No. Elena is...Elena's warm and she's...she's kind, and she's caring, and she's selfless, and it's real. And honestly when I'm around her, I...I completely forget what I am.
Lexi: Oh my god! You're in love with her.
Stefan: Yeah. Yeah, I am.
Mystic Grill
[At the mystic grill party. Caroline finds Damon at the bar.]

Caroline: Amazing party right?
Damon: Glad you thought of it.
Caroline: Well, are you having a good time?
Damon: Do you have my crystal?
Caroline: No.
Damon: Then I'm not having a good time.
[Damon sees Lexi enter the Grill and leaves Caroline to go over to her.]

Damon: Where's my brother?
Lexi: He said he'd meet me here.
Damon: Buy you a,  [Lexi walks away from him.]
Gilbert Residence
[Elena opens the door to find Stefan on the porch.]

Stefan: Hey.
Elena: What are you doing here?
Stefan: Lexi said that you came by and you seemed upset.
Elena: Right. The girl in the towel.
Stefan: The towel?...Oh no no no no not like that, she's not exactly a girl--Lexi's just 350 years old
Elena: You mean she's a...
Stefan: And she's my oldest friend. Nothing romantic. Ever.
Elena: Oh, okay, well....she kept staring at me. It was weird.
Stefan: Yeah well I've talk about you a lot so...I guess she felt like she knew you.So why'd you come by?
Elena: I-uh...it was a mistake.
Stefan: Elena talk to me.
Elena: I can't. Stefan I can't, and that's the problem. I'm keeping all these secrets from everyone. I can't even tell my best friend. Do you know how hard that is? It's like I need to talk to someone but the only person I can talk to is you....and...
Stefan: I want you to know that I will always be here for you. You can come to me about anything okay?
Elena: Well, thank you for coming by.
Stefan: Hey, do you need a ride to the grill tonight?
Elena: Are you going to Caroline's party?
Stefan: Lexi's dragging me and...it's my birthday.
Elena: Really? Wow-um, happy birthday then.
Stefan: Thank you.
Elena: Actually I, I think I'm gonna stay in tonight.
Stefan: Well have a...have a good night.
Mystic Grill
[People having fun. Caroline walks up to Bonnie.]

Caroline: Bonnie I've been looking for you. I'm totally sorry to do this I know it's so Indian giver and I know we're not even supposed to say that anymore but I need my crystal back.
Bonnie: Why? You said you hated it.
Caroline: Then I saw it on you and I realize how great it is, and I've got three outfits I can coordinate it with so....
Bonnie: I can't give it back to you.
Caroline: Well, I didn't want to tell you this but I'm your friend, when you wear it makes you look fat. There I said it, but it's because I'm your friend so...
Bonnie: I'm sorry Caroline, I can't.
Caroline: What do you mean you can't? Bonnie it's mine.
Bonnie: I thought you said it was Damon's.
Caroline: It is.
Bonnie: So he's the one who really wants it back.
Caroline: No. Maybe, just...[Caroline tries to snatch the crystal off of Bonnie but it shocks her.] Are you wearing polyester?
Bonnie: You were really gonna pull it from my neck. What the hell is wrong with you? [walks away]
Caroline: Argh!
[Stefan enters the Grill. Matt walks past him.]

Stefan: Matt, just hear me out please. I was just trying to help Vicki. I went through something similar once, I'm really sorry.
Matt: Don't be. It's not the first time she's run off. Turns out Vicki's just like our mother; I can't count on either of them. Thanks for trying.
[Damon runs into Caroline again.]

Damon: Where is it?
Caroline: Bonnie won't give it to me.
Damon: So rip it off her neck.
Caroline: I tried. It shocked me.
Damon: Damn it! Why does it do that? I need that crystal.
Caroline: Why are you being like this? I'm so good to you and I'd do anything. It's just some stupid necklace.
Damon: No, you are the only stupid thing here. And shallow. And useless. [walks away from her.]
[Lexi is dancing but Stefan isn't.]

Lexi: Okay, I'm gonna need a little more foot movement.
Stefan: Yeah, not really interested in making a fool out of myself.
Lexi: Come on, you're not that bad.
Stefan: Do me a favor. Tell me if you see Damon with his camera phone.
Lexi: Right.
[Damon exits the Grill. He hears a sound and follows.]

Girl: Where are we going?
Boy: No one's gonna see us....
[They kiss each other Damon sees it.]

Girl: Did you hear something?
Boy: No, it's cool. There's no one coming down here.
[Damon arrives and bites the boy. The girl starts screaming, then looks into Damon's eyes and stops]

[Stefan is playing pool with Lexi. He makes a good move.]

Stefan: Woo!
Lexi: Nice!
[Elena arrives and sees Stefan having a great time with Lexi. Damon comes up behind her.]

Damon: Stefan smiles. Alert the media.
Elena: You haven't given him a lot of reasons to be happy lately.
Damon: Oh, you're right. Poor Stefan persecuted throughout eternity by his depraved brother; does it get tiring being so righteous?
Elena: It flares up in the presence of psychopaths.
Damon: Ouch! Well, consider this psychopath's feelings get hurt.
Elena: What did you do to my brother?
Damon: I'm gonna need a less vague question.
Elena: When you did what you did to Jeremy's memory of Vicki, what else did you do to him?
Damon: You asked me to take away his memory of fangs and all the bad stuff. You wanted me to take away his suffering.
Elena: But he's acting different. He seems okay with everything and a little too okay. I mean he's studying; he's not doing drugs; he's not drinking; are you sure you didn't do something else?
Damon: Elena, I took away the suffering.
[Bonnie walks into Caroline and stops her.]

Bonnie: Caroline.
Caroline: Don't talk to me.
Bonnie: Don't do that, let me explain.
Caroline: What is there to explain Bonnie? You got what you wanted...and something that doesn't even belong to you by the way and, I get called a shallow, useless waste of space.
Bonnie: Who said that to you?
Caroline: Who do you think?
Bonnie: You know that not true. Don't let him treat you like that.
Caroline: As opposed to how my best friend treats me. [walks off]
[Outside, a police officer is patrolling in his car.]

Girl: [whimpers] Help me.
[Officer hears her and goes to investigate. He finds the boy's body in a pool of blood.]

[Inside the Grill, at the bar.]

Lexi: Two shots of tequila. [sees Elena] Make that three.
Barman: I need to see some ID.
Lexi: No you don't. [uses compulsion]
Barman: That'll be, 
Lexi: Free!
Barman: On the house.
Lexi: Thanks!
[She leaves with the tequila and goes over to Elena.]

Lexi: Oh! The famous Elena.
Elena: Towel girl.
Lexi: I've been called worse. Here. [offers Elena tequila]
Elena: [she takes tequila] I didn't know that you guys could drink.
Lexi: Oh yeah, it helps curb the cravings, but makes for a lot of lushy vamps.
Elena: [laughs] You know, I've never seen Stefan drunk. He always seem so...
Lexi: Uptight?
Elena: [nods]Yeah.
Lexi: Yeah.
Elena: But not with you.
Lexi: Well that the benefit of knowing someone for over a hundred years. You can just be yourself.
Elena: Yeah, he can't be himself with me.
Lexi: Well not yet. The first step was him telling you. The rest comes with time.
Elena: You seem so sure.
Lexi: The love of my life was human. He went through, what I imagine you're going through: denial, anger, et cetera. But at the end of the day, love really did conquer all. [indicates to Elena's tequila] Are you going to drink that?
Elena: Go for it. [Lexi takes the drink] I'm scared.
Lexi: But you're here...'cause you're crazy about him, I get it okay? I mean what's not to love. [they look over at Stefan] Listen. Take it from someone who's been around a long time. When it's real, you can't walk away.
Elena: Hey Lexi. It was really nice meeting you.
[She laughs as Lexi drinks the last tequila. Lexi returns to the pool table where Stefan is playing.]

Lexi: Yep, I drank yours, sorry.
Stefan: [smiles] Thank you.
Lexi: [understands] You weren't supposed to be listening. [sees his face] I was feeling epic, whatever.
[Outside.]

Sheriff Forbes: Keep this contained.
Officer: That's not all. [he shows her the frightened witness, the girl.]
Sheriff Forbes: Hey, hey. Did you see what did this? [the girl nods] Tell me everything you saw.
[Inside, Elena rejoins Stefan.]

Elena: Hi!
Stefan: Hey, you came.
Elena: I couldn't miss your hundredth and...whatever birthday. [smiles]
[Caroline stumbles into table where Matt is talking to a friend.]

Matt: Oh hey!
Caroline: I slim---I'm slipped. I slipped.
Matt: Hammered, huh?
Caroline: Well...a very nice but not handsome bartender was very kind to me tonight. Unlike the rest of the global universe. Are those curly fries?
Matt: [to the friend] Coffee for the drunk girl. [Friend leaves and Caroline sits down] Bad night huh?
Caroline: Baddest. Am I shallow?
Matt: Is that a trick question?
Caroline: I don't mean to be. I wanna be deep. I wanna be, like...the abyss deep.
Matt: No offense, Care, but deep's really not your scene.
Caroline: That's true. I'm shallow, I am worst than shallow, I'm a kiddie pool!
Matt: You're not a kiddie pool. You're not a kiddie pool.
Caroline: Can I just go home okay?
Matt: I'll take you come on. You're okay. [Matt lifts her up] She's still alright; Hold still, Hold still.
[Outside Matt runs into Sheriff Forbes.]

Sheriff Forbes: What happened is she okay?
Caroline: Like you care.
Sheriff Forbes: She's drunk?
Caroline: As a skunk.
Sheriff Forbes: Are they serving you in there?
Matt: I'll take her home. It's on my way. I haven't been drinking.
Sheriff Forbes: I would appreciate that, Matt, thank you. [to Caroline] You and I will discuss this later.
Caroline: Can't wait. [leaves with Matt]
Sheriff Forbes: [to the officers] Don't let anybody else leave.
[By the bar. Lexi walks up to Damon with drinks.]

Lexi: All right, the shots are a bribe. I need you to answer a question. What are you really doing in Mystic Falls?
Damon: Have you tried The Brittle. It wins award.
Lexi: Cut the crap.
Damon: Okay, I have a diabolical master plan.
Lexi: What is it?
Damon: If I told you it wouldn't be very diabolical, now would it?
[Sheriff Forbes comes in with the girl.]

Sheriff Forbes: Look around let me know if you see anything.
[The girl points to the bar where Damon and Lexi are sitting. Sheriff Forbes walks over and injects Lexi with vervain.]

Damon: What are you doing?!
Sheriff Forbes: Thank you for the vervain; now if you'll excuse me.
[Stefan sees what's happening.]

Stefan: Oh my god!
Elena: What is it?
[Stefan tries to leave the Grill.]

Stefan: Excuse me, sorry.
Officer: Can't go out this way
[Outside, the officers and Sheriff are taking Lexi to the police car when she throws the officers off. Sheriff Forbes shoots her with wooden bullets, but Lexi is too strong. Out of nowhere, Damon appears and stakes her. Stefan sees and pulls Elena out of sight from the scene.]

Stefan: [in shock] Oh my god!
Lexi: [to Damon] Why?
Damon: [whispers] It's part of the plan.
[Lexi falls to the ground, dead. Damon turns to the Sheriff.]

Damon: You okay?
Sheriff Forbes: [nods] Thank you. Get her in the car quickly.
Damon: All right.
[Inside The Grill. Sheriff Forbes arrests the barman and takes him to the police car.]

Barman: Lady, I checked everyone's IDs.
Sheriff Forbes: Yeah, apparently you didn't.
[She sees Damon.]

Sheriff Forbes: Pretty handy with that stake.
Damon: It just...reflex. I guess the adrenaline kicked in.
Sheriff Forbes: This nightmare is finally over.
Damon: Yeah call a lucky break with that witness, without her you wouldn't have been able to ID the vampire.
Sheriff Forbes: We're lucky. Well thank you again.
Damon: You're welcome.
Forbes Residence
[In Caroline's Bedroom.]

Matt: You gonna be okay?
Caroline: No. Do you ever feel like there's not a person in the world that loves you?
Matt: Life can be a little rough.
Caroline: I just wish...
Matt: What?
Caroline: Wish that life was...different.
Matt: Yeah me too. [turns to leave]
Caroline: Please....don't leave me alone.
[Matt hesitates, then awkwardly climbs onto the bed next to Caroline.]

Mystic Grill
[Outside, Stefan is walking away in anger and horror.]

Elena: [follows] Stefan! Stefan!
Stefan: He killed her! He killed Zach; he killed Tanner; he turned Vicki; I have to kill him!
Elena: No, you can't do that!
Stefan: Why are you trying to save him?! Elena he's never gonna change! Don't you see that?! He's never gonna change!
Elena: I'm not trying to save him, I'm trying to save you! You have no idea what this will do to you, please Stefan.
Stefan: Everywhere I've been, pain and death follow; Damon follows me. No more.
Elena: Stefan please. Please just-just talk to me; Let me be here for you. Talk to me.
Stefan: No. You were right to stay away from me. [leaves]
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is having a drink inside when Stefan arrives.]

Damon: Told you I'd take care of it.
[Stefan runs and attacks him. The brothers fight until Stefan pins Damon against the wall.]

Damon: Come on, I did this for you. To get them off our trail.
Stefan: You never do anything for anyone but yourself. [stabs a stake in him]
Damon: [shocked] You missed!
Stefan: No. You saved my life. I'm sparing yours. We're even. And now we're done.
[Stefan leaves as Damon falls to the ground and pulls out the stake.]

Benett Residence
[In Bonnie's Dream, she is running through the woods. She stops by old ruins of a church. She turns around and comes face-to-face with her ancestor, Emily.]

Emily: It's coming.
[Bonnie wakes up in the woods near the old church.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Bonnie sits at her desk in math class, trying to stay awake during a boring lecture.]

Teacher: Today we're going to talk about shadow reckoning. This is a method of measuring heights by the sun's shadow. Let's say, for example, that we're going to measure the distance of a shadow. We're gonna take this measure here, measure the length, and we're going to multiply that by the height of the source. Building height can also be measured, using a clinometer, which we're going to make in class tomorrow.
[Bored, Bonnie glances around and notices something in the hallway. She gets up and follows a woman who turns out to be her ancestor, Emily Bennett.]

Bonnie: Hello?
[She follows Emily out of the double doors.]

Fell's Church
[Magically Bonnie finds herself in the ruins of Fell's Church. Emily is there, waiting for her.]

Emily: Please, help me.
Bonnie: Who are you?
Emily: I'm Emily. [smiles] You know that. We're family.
Bonnie: Where am I?
Emily: This is where it started. And this is where it has to end.
Bonnie: [shakes head in disbelief] No. This isn't real.
[Bonnie tries to run away, but Emily keeps blocking her path.]

Emily: Help me.
Mystic Falls High School
[Bonnie wakes up with a gasp in class. Everyone stares at her, including the girl sitting next to her.]

Bonnie: [to the girl] What are you looking at? Turn around.
[She turns to the other side, and realizes Emily is sitting in the desk next to her. She screams.]

Fell's Church
[Bonnie wakes up in the middle of the ruins of Fell's Church.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Outside, Elena and Caroline are walking towards the school.]

Elena: Have you even talked to Bonnie?
Caroline: No, I'm mad at her. She needs to make the first move.
Elena: Be the bigger person.
Caroline: Impossible in her presence.
Elena: Why are you so pissed at her anyway?
Caroline: She's a thief, that's why. I gave her my necklace, and she refuses to give it back. It's a matter of principle.
Elena: [sighs] All right. Well, I tried. I'm officially out of it.
Caroline: Good. Your turn. Where's Stefan? Have you talked to him?
Elena: He's avoiding me.
Caroline: Why?
Elena: [hesitates as she tries to think of what she can say]  ...It's complicated. [the bells rings, giving Elena an excuse to leave] I'll see you later.
Caroline: Bye.
[Elena leaves. Matt and Caroline pass each other.]

Matt: Hey.
Caroline: Hey.
[Caroline is disappointed, and stares at him before walking away.]

[In history class, Elena sits down in class near Bonnie as Alaric, the new teacher, prepares for his class.]

Alaric: Good Morning everyone. Alrighty.
[Alaric writes his name on the chalkboard. Elena mouths Are you okay? to Bonnie. Bonnie shrugs.]

Alaric: Alaric Saltzman. It's a mouthful, I know. Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. Saltzman is of German origins. My family emigrated here in 1755 to Texas. I, however, was born and raised in Boston. Now the name Alaric belongs to a very dead great-grandfather I will never be able to thank enough. You'll probably want to pronounce Alaric but it's Alaric, okay? So, you can call me Rick. I'm your new history teacher.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon enters Stefan's room and wakes him up with a coffee for him.]

Damon: Rise and shine! [hands him the coffee] You'll be late for school.
Stefan: What? What are you doing?
Damon: Peace offering. Come on, you need it for blood circulation. Does dead flesh good! [Stefan makes a face, and Damon sighs] All right. I'm sorry.
Stefan: [gets out of bed and starts to get ready] Step aside, please.
Damon: I got the town off our back. It was for the greater good, but I'm sorry. And, to prove it, I'm not gonna feed on a human. [beat] For at least a week. I'll adopt a Stefan diet! Only nothing with feathers.
Stefan: [mocks Damon] 'Cause I realize that killing your closest and oldest friend is beyond evil, and yet somehow, it's worthy of humor.
Damon: Are you mimicking me?
Stefan: [continues to mock him] Yes, Stefan. Now that the secret society of vampires haters is off our back, I can go back to my routine of How can I destroy Stefan's life this week?
Damon: [mocks Stefan back] And I can go back to sulking and Elena-longing and forehead brooding. [laughs] This is fun! I like this.
Stefan: [still mocking Damon] And I will finally reveal the ulterior motive behind my evil and diabolical return to Mystic Falls.
Damon: Yeah. I'm done. That's just like you, Damon. Always have to have the last word.
Mystic Falls High School
[Bonnie is explaining to Elena about her dreams.]

Bonnie: And then, I ended up at the remains of the old Fell's church before I woke up back in the woods.
Elena: And you always see your ancestor Emily?
Bonnie: Mhm. Do you believe in ghosts?
Elena: Two weeks ago I'd say no, but now...
Bonnie: Because I think I'm being haunted.
Elena: I don't get it. Why Emily?
Bonnie: Grams said she was a powerful witch back in the Civil War days, and that this medallion was hers. A witch's talisman.
Elena: And it all started when you got the necklace?
Bonnie: I think she's using it to communicate with me.
Elena: Okay, what does Grams say about it?
Bonnie: I can't call her. She's gonna tell me to embrace it. I don't want to embrace it, I want it to stop.
[In the history classroom. Jeremy walks into Alaric's class and greets Alaric, who is eating his lunch at his desk.]

Jeremy: Hey Mr. Saltzman, I'm Jeremy Gilbert. You wanted to see me?
Alaric: [finishes chewing and sets down his sandwich] You know that your old teacher had a jackass file? No joke. [holds up the file] It's typed on a label. It has all the troublemakers in it. But really it's just an opus-- to you. [Jeremy looks at him in alarm] Don't worry about it. [throws the file in the trashcan] I'm not him. Clean slate. Now...let's talk about grades.
Jeremy: I know it's been a rough couple of months, but I've been trying to turn them around.
Alaric: Yeah, I saw that. But, the problem is, we're halfway through a semester and half a fail is still pretty bleak. [beat] This is the part where you say to me, But what can I do to change that? I'm glad you asked! How do you feel about extra credit?
Jeremy: [shakes his head in agreement] Yeah, yeah, totally! Whatever.
Alaric: [smiles] Good! Write me a paper, then.
Jeremy: Okay. About what?
Alaric: History. Pick a topic, keep it local, and no Wikipedia-regurgita. These old towns have a rich history, so just get your hands dirty, make it sing and your back on track. Deal?
Jeremy: [grateful] Yeah. Deal. [notices a large ring on Alaric's finger] That's a cool ring.
Alaric: [awkward] Oh, thanks. It was my father's. A little garish, but family, you know? [returns to topic at hand] You've got a week.
[Matt passes Caroline again outside.]

Matt: Hey.
Caroline: [stops him] Hey, what is that?
Matt: What is what?
Caroline: The hey! That's twice. That is two heys. That--do you have any other words in your vocabulary?
Matt: [confused] What's wrong with hey?
Caroline: It reeks of awkward subtext. You spent the night in my bed! There was cuddling! And then, you snuck out before dawn so you wouldn't have to face me, which I must say is a total Lame-Guy move that I did not appreciate. And now with the heys? Seriously? I mean, I may have been some pathetic, insecure mess after the party, but do not mistake that for me being a pushover, because I do not let guys mess with my head anymore.
Matt: I heard your mom in the morning, and I didn't want to get you in trouble. So, I went out the window.
Caroline: You went out the window? Another Lame-Guy move.
Matt: Your mom's the sheriff! And as for the heys, I'm pretty sure it's what I've said to you every day since the first grade. Trying to read something into it? Lame-Girl move.
[Elsewhere outside the school, Elena sees Stefan sitting at a picnic table and walks over to join him.]

Stefan: Hi.
Elena: You weren't in class, I was worried.
Stefan: Yeah, I got your messages, and I'm sorry I didn't get back to you, but what I wanna say shouldn't be said over the phone.
Elena: A simple I didn't kill my brother text would have sufficed.
Stefan: I didn't kill my brother, as much as he deserved it. He has you to thank you for that.
Elena: So, what did you wanna tell me?
Stefan: I won't be coming to school anymore. I'm gonna back off and keep my distance. It's the right thing to do.
Elena: Back off from school or from me? [awkward silence] Thank you for telling me.
Stefan: It's better this way.
Elena: [upset] Yep. I got it.
Stefan: You're angry. That's good. It'll be easier if you hate me.
[In the parking lot, Bonnie is walking to her car. Once she reaches it, she runs into Damon.]

Damon: Okay, it's your last chance.
Bonnie: [scared] I'm gonna scream.
Damon: Oh no, Don't do that. Let's stay on point. I want my necklace.
Bonnie: You can't have it.
Damon: I can't take it, but you can give it to me. I'm trying to help you, here.
Bonnie: I don't want your help.
Damon: You do want my help, and you don't even know it. You know why, you little witch? 'Cause you've stumbled into something you need to stumble out of.
Bonnie: Just leave me alone or I swear--
Damon: Don't! No threats. Look, A, you hurt me last time. B, I wish you no harm. Believe it or not, Bonnie, I wanna protect you. Let me help you get Emily off your back.
Bonnie: [confused] How do you know about her?
Damon: I know a lot of things, and I know more about that crystal than you do, and I know that she's using it to creep inside of you. See how scared you are? And, you should be, because I will get that crystal, even if I have to wait for Emily to give it to me herself. So, next time she comes out to play, you tell her that a deal's a deal.
[Damon opens Bonnie's car door for her, and once she's inside, he closes it for her.]

Bonnie's Car
[Bonnie is driving her car, with Elena in the passenger seat, as they discuss what happened.]

Bonnie: He's bad news, Elena. He really scared me.
Elena: You need to stay as far away from Damon as possible.
Bonnie: I'm trying! He just keeps showing up.
Elena: I don't want you to be alone. You're sleeping at my place tonight, we can make a whole night out of it.
[Bonnie pulls over to the side of the road and gets out of the car.]

Elena: Whoa! Where are you going?
[Bonnie rips off the necklace and throws it into a field.]

Elena: Are you okay?
Bonnie: Now I am. All my problems were because of that thing. I can't believe I didn't do that sooner.
Elena: What's your Grams gonna say?
Bonnie: Grams isn't the one being haunted by a hundred and fifty-year-old ghost, is she?
Elena: [sighs] Okay, then.
Mystic Grill
[Jenna and Jeremy are sitting at a booth. Jenna watches Alaric at another table.]

Jenna: I like a man who can dine alone. A quiet strength.
Jeremy: I thought you were still in that whole Logan-depression thing.
Jenna: [smiles] I've sworn off men forever, but it doesn't mean I can't observe them from a safe distance.
Jeremy: Well, I can introduce you.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena answers the door to find Stefan on her porch.]

Elena: Hey. Thanks for coming. I wouldn't have called if it wasn't important.
Stefan: I know that.
[Elena steps onto the porch and pulls the door closed behind her.]

Elena: He threatened her, Stefan.
Stefan: What would Damon want with Bonnie?
Elena: She has this necklace. Caroline got it from Damon, and she gave it to Bonnie, and now Damon wants it back. He's tormenting her.
Stefan: Over a necklace?
Elena: It's not just any necklace. It has to do with Bonnie's heritage. It belonged to one of her ancestors who lived here during the Civil War...[realizes that Stefan and Damon were alive then] When you and Damon lived here.
Stefan: [looks uncomfortable] Her name was Emily. She was Katherine's handmaiden, and a witch.
Elena: [surprised] You know? About Bonnie?
Stefan: The first night that you invited me over for dinner, I made the connection.
Elena: And now Damon knows, and for some reason he wants that necklace.
Stefan: What does it look like?
Elena: It's an antique iron setting with a--
Stefan: --with an amber crystal. I know it. It belonged to Katherine. Emily gave it to her, which means that...
Elena: What?
Stefan: [confused] I don't know, but I'm gonna find it out. Let me talk to Damon.
Elena: Will he tell you?
Stefan: I'll get it out of him.
Mystic Grill
[Jeremy and Jenna continue to have dinner and talk about their day.]

Jenna: Have you picked a topic?
Jeremy: No, not yet. It's gotta be local and non-internet research, so...
Jenna: That's easy! You've got all your dad's stuff.
Jeremy: What stuff?
Jenna: How the Gilberts came over on the Mayflower stuff, all that family lineage from way back. Your dad really loved all that family history stuff. It's all boxed up in the closet.
[Alaric approaches Jenna and Jeremy at their table.]

Jeremy: Mr. Saltzman.
Alaric: Jeremy. What's up, man?
Jeremy: This is my aunt, Jenna.
Alaric: [shakes her hand] Alaric Saltzman. It's nice to meet you.
Jenna: Jeremy was just telling me about his paper. Thanks for giving him another chance.
Alaric: It was my first day. I wanted to make a good impression.
[Damon is drinking at the bar. Stefan approaches him.]

Stefan: So, Stefan...You know, I've been thinking. I think we should start over, give this brother thing another chance. We used to do it, oh-so well, once upon time.
Damon: I don't, Damon. I can't trust you to be a nice guy. You kill everybody, and you're so mean. You're so mean, and...[gives up on mocking him] You're really hard to imitate, and then I have to go to that lesser place...
Stefan: [to bartender] Can I get a coffee, please? [to Damon] So, what's with the bottle?
Damon: I'm on edge. Crash diet. You know, I'm trying to keep a low profile.
Stefan: You could always just leave, find a new town to turn into your own personal Gas 'n' Sip.
Damon: I'll manage. You don't have to keep an eye on me.
Stefan: I'm not here to keep an eye on you.
Damon: So, why are you here?
Stefan: Why not?
Gilbert Residence
[Bonnie, Caroline, and Elena are preparing dinner. Elena gives Caroline a look.]

Caroline: [sighs] I'm sorry. There. I said it. If you want the ugly-ass necklace, keep it. It's yours.
Bonnie: [looks guilty] Will you hate me if I tell you I threw it away?
Caroline: [annoyed] You threw it away?
Bonnie: I know it sounds crazy, but the necklace was giving me nightmares. I had to get rid of it.
Caroline: You could have just given it back to me.
Elena: [interrupts] Why? So you could give it back to Damon?
Caroline: Screw Damon. Are we doing manicures or what? Who has their kit?
Bonnie: Mine's in my bag.
Caroline: [rifles through Bonnie's purse for the manicure kit] So, Elena...how long do you think this fight with Stefan's gonna last? Is it...like a permanent thing?
Elena: I don't know, Caroline.
Caroline: [suddenly angry] Why are you such a little liar, Bonnie?
Bonnie: What?
Elena: [astonished] Caroline!
[Caroline holds up the crystal, and Bonnie and Elena gape at her in shock.]

Bonnie: I'm not lying to you, Caroline. I swear.
Elena: It's true. I watched her throw it into a field!
Caroline: [frustrated] Then explain it.
Bonnie: Emily.
Caroline: [confused] Who's Emily?
Bonnie: The ghost.
Caroline: [mocking] Oh, the ghost has a name now?
Elena: Caroline, please.
Bonnie: [to Elena] I wonder why she won't leave me alone.
Caroline: What is going on? Why am I not a part of this conversation? You guys do this to me all the time.
Elena: That's not true.
Bonnie: Yes it is. I can't talk to you. You don't listen.
Caroline: That's not true.
Bonnie: I'm a witch.
Caroline: And don't we all know it?
Bonnie: See? That's what I'm talking about. I'm trying to tell you something. You don't even hear it.
Caroline: I listen. When do I not listen?
Mystic Grill
[Jenna approaches Alaric at his table.]

Jenna: Jeremy totally ditched me.
Alaric: Where's he go?
Jenna: Home. It's not far. He can walk it.
Alaric: So, are you from here? Are you a townie?
Jenna: I'm a returnee. Left town for a while, now I'm back.
Alaric: Why'd you leave?
Jenna: School. And then there's the real reason. I was wronged...a guy named Logan.
Alaric: What'd he do?
Jenna: Basics...lied, cheated, lured me back in, left me again. Your turn. Any sad relationship stories?
Alaric: The basics...fell in love, married young, my wife died.
Jenna: [awkward] Oh. Wow.
Alaric: Yeah, that's always a good conversation stopper.
Jenna: What happened?
Alaric: Well, you, me and the North Carolina police department are all wondering the same thing. It's what's known as a cold case.
Jenna: So, why'd you move here?
Alaric: A change of pace, new scenery. I like it here. It's got a rich history.
[Across the restaurant, Stefan and Damon are playing darts.]

Damon: Lucky shot.
Stefan: More like a carefully honed skill over many decades.
Damon: You're beating me.
Stefan: Yeah. It's because I'm better than you.
Damon: I'm onto you. Reverse psychology. It's a little transparent, but I admire the effort.
Stefan: You prefer the brooding forehead?
Damon: Seriously, what game do you think you're playing?
Stefan: That's a funny question considering the fact that I have been asking you that for months. It's frustrating isn't it?
Damon: Touche.
Gilbert Residence
[Caroline and Bonnie are talking in a room by themselves.]

Caroline: Bonnie. Look, it's just not me. I don't believe in the...[gestures with her hands and makes a noise] woo woo. But, if you do, then...okay. I'm in. That's all it takes for me to jump on board, because I consider you to be my best friend. And I'm saying this, knowing that Elena's in the kitchen listening to my every word. Look, I didn't know how real this was for you, but I'm listening now. Okay? [calls out into the other room] Elena, you can come in now. We're done. [Elena enters shyly, smiling] There is just way too much drama in this room. So, what do you guys wanna do? I have an idea. Why don't we have a seance?
Bonnie: [nervous] I don't think that's a good idea.
Caroline: Come on. Let's summon some spirits. This Emily chick has some serious explaining to do.
[They move to Elena's bedroom to do the seance.]

Bonnie: What are we doing?
Elena: I don't know.
Caroline: Be quiet and concentrate. Close your eyes. Now take a deep breath. Bonnie. Call to her.
Bonnie: Emily, you there?
Caroline: Really? Emily, you there? That's all you got? Come on.
Bonnie: Fine, geez. Emily. I call on you. I know you have a message. I'm here to listen.
[The candles immediately flare stronger.]

Elena: Did that just...
Caroline: Yeah, it just happened.
Bonnie: It's just the air conditioning.
Caroline: Ask her to show you a sign. Ask her. Emily, if you're among us, show us another sign.
[They wait a moment, but nothing happens.]

Bonnie: See? It's not working. [the windows burst open, scaring her] I can't, I'm done. [Bonnie rips the necklace off and throws it on the ground next to the candles, which blow out, scaring her more] Get the light. Please, get the light!
Elena: Hold on. I got it.
Bonnie: You guys, the necklace. It's gone.
Mystic Falls High School
[Stefan brings Damon to the football field, and decides to play a little football with his brother.]

Damon: What are we doin' here?
Stefan: Bonding. Catch! Go on. Give it a try.
Damon: Don't forget who taught you how to play this game.
[They start to play, and each of them run around with vampire speed until Stefan tackles Damon.]

Damon: [groans] That hurt.
Stefan: Downside of my diet--getting hit actually hurts a little bit.
Damon: I'm impressed Stefan. Fun with booze and darts, sentimental with football, and now? Starry night. What do you want, Stefan?
Stefan: It wasn't real, Damon. Our love for Katherine. She compelled us. We didn't have a choice. Took me years to sort that out, to truly understand what she did to us.
Damon: [pulls himself off the floor] Oh, no, Stefan. We are not takin' that on tonight. [he starts to walk away.]
Stefan: What do you want with Katherine's crystal?
Damon: [stops on his tracks] How do you know about that?
Stefan: Come on. You knew Elena would tell me.
Damon: How do you know it was Katherine's? Emily gave it to her on her last night. I was with her, and you weren't.
Stefan: I was the last one to see her, Damon. Now, what do you want with Katherine's crystal?
Damon: She didn't tell you?
Stefan: We had other things on our mind.
[Damon vampspeeds over to Stefan and gets in his face.]

Damon: I could rip your heart out and not think twice about it.
Stefan: [smirks] I've heard that before.
Damon: I have a bigger surprise, Stefan. [backs away slowly] I'm gonna bring her back.
Gilbert Residence
[The girls are standing in the aftermath of their seance, shocked.]

Elena: Okay, fun's over, Caroline. You made a point, and I get it. Now give it back.
Caroline: What? Well, I didn't take it. What? What happened?
Elena: I don't know. Nothing. Jeremy, are you home?
[Elena walks into the hall to check for her brother. Bonnie sees the crystal on the floor in the bathroom. She goes in to get it.]

Bonnie: Guys...[The door slams shut as soon as she's inside the room] You guys open the door! Help me!
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! What's going on, Bonnie?
Caroline: Bonnie!
[Caroline and Elena pound on the door as Bonnie screams for help.]

Elena: Try the other door. I'll check the hallway.
Caroline: Bonnie! Bonnie! Unlock the door!
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Open the door!
[The door opens. Bonnie stands with her head in her hands.]

Elena: What happened? Are you okay?
Bonnie and Emily: I'm fine.
Caroline: Unbelievable. You were totally faking it.
Elena: Caroline, come on.
Caroline: No! You scared the hell out of me.
Elena: Bonnie?
Bonnie and Emily: I'm fine. Everything's fine.
Mystic Falls High School
[Stefan and Damon are still in the football field after Damon's revelation.]

Stefan: How can you bring Katherine back?
Damon: Before Katherine and the others were killed in the church, you remember what it was like in this town?
Stefan: I remember the fear and the hysteria.
Damon: Townspeople were killing vampires one by one. When they came for Katherine, I went straight to Emily, said,I'll do anything. Name your price. Just protect her. She did.
Stefan: How?
Damon: She did some kind of spell with the crystal. And while the church was burning, and we thought Katherine was burning in it, she wasn't.
Stefan: But I saw her go inside...
Damon: There's a tomb underneath the church. The spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
Stefan: Are you telling me that Katherine's alive?
Damon: If that's what you wanna call it. She's been trapped in a mystical holding cell for the last century and a half, but you're an expert on starving a vampire, so how do you think she's doing, Stefan? Did you know that witches can use celestial events to draw energy into their magic? Me either. But in order to give the crystal its power, Emily used the comet that was passing overhead. And, in order for that crystal to work again...
Stefan: The comet had to return.
Damon: Downside? Long time in between comets. And, a couple of hiccups along the way with the crystal, but the comet passed, and I got the crystal. And then Caroline got the crystal, and now Bonnie has the crystal, and here we are.
Stefan: Why would Emily...? Why would she do this for you?
Damon: Because she knew they were gonna come for her, too, and she made me promise that her lineage would survive.
Stefan: I remember. You saved her children.
Damon: It's the only thing keeping me from ripping that little Bonnie girl's throat out to get my crystal back. Oh well, a deal's a deal. So...you wanna go throw some more?
Gilbert Residence
[Elena and Caroline are running after Bonnie and Emily, who is rushing down the stairs.]

Caroline: I can't believe I fell for it.
Elena: [to Bonnie] Are you okay?
Bonnie and Emily: I must go.
Caroline: She's leaving. I'm leaving.
Elena: You guys can't leave.
Caroline: I can. I've had enough freaky fake witch stuff for one night.
Bonnie and Emily: Thank you for having me. I'll take it from here.
Elena: Where are you going?
Bonnie and Emily: Back to where it all began.
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! Oh My God! Emily!
Bonnie and Emily: I won't let him have it. It must be destroyed.
Elena: Wait!
[Bonnie and Emily leaves. Elena chases her down the stairs. She tries to open the door, but Emily has spelled it shut.]

Caroline: What's happening?
Elena: I don't know. The door, it's not...
[The door finally opens, and Jeremy walks in. The girls scream, and Jeremy is really confused.]

Jeremy: What the hell?
Caroline: I'm outta here.
[Elena calls Stefan.]

Stefan: What's wrong?
Elena: It's Bonnie.
Stefan: What happened?
Elena: Emily is possessing her. She said something.
Stefan: What did she say?
Elena: She said I won't let him have it. It must be destroyed. And then she just left.
Stefan: Where do you think she went?
Elena: I don't know. [thinks about it] Fell's church, by the old cemetery that's where she took Bonnie in her dreams. We have to help her, Stefan.
Stefan: Just stay there. I'm gonna go find her.
Fell's Church
[Damon finds Bonnie in the ruins of the old church, setting up a spell.]

Damon: Hello Emily. You look different.
Bonnie and Emily: I won't let you do it.
Damon: We had a deal.
Bonnie and Emily: Things are different now. I need to protect my family.
Damon: I protected your family. You owe me.
Bonnie and Emily: I know. I'm sorry.
Damon: You're about to be a lot more than that.
[Damon tries to attack her, but Emily uses her powers to throw Damon against a tree, and he's impaled on a branch through his stomach.]

Gilbert Residence
[Alaric walks Jenna to the door of the Gilbert House]

Jenna: You're so wrong. I'm much more pathetic.
Alaric: Oh no no. I've got you beat. I have pathetic down to a science.
Jenna: Oh no. We haven't even covered high school. Braces, A-cup.
Alaric: Glasses, skin condition.
[Alaric walks to the threshold of the door, then stops.]

Jenna: You can...You know what? I'm not gonna invite you in. [gestures inside] Jeremy.
Alaric: Well, some other time then. Have a good night, Jenna.
[Alaric leaves. Jenna goes inside and finds Jeremy searching through his dad's family history.]

Jenna: So, you found the boxes.
Jeremy: I found this, too.
[He hands her a photo of her and Logan from when they were in high school.]

Jenna: Me and Logan. That's just cruel.
Jeremy: Cruel is dating my history teacher.
Jenna: [smirks] I'm not dating him...yet.
Fell's Church
[Stefan and Elena arrive at the church ruins. Stefan pulls Damon off of the tree branch.]

Damon: It hurts. This is why I feed on people.
Bonnie and Emily: Stefan.
Stefan: Hello, Emily.
Bonnie and Emily: These people don't deserve this. They should never have to know such evil.
Stefan: What do you mean evil?
Damon: Emily. I swear to God, I'll make you regret this.
Bonnie and Emily: I won't let you unleash them into this world.
Stefan: Them? What part of the story did you leave out, Damon?
Damon: What does it matter?
Stefan: Emily, tell me what you did.
Bonnie and Emily: To save her, I had to save them.
Stefan: You saved everyone in the church?
Bonnie and Emily: With one, comes all.
Damon: I don't care about them. I just want Katherine.
Stefan: I knew I shouldn't have believed a single word that comes out of your mouth. This isn't about love, is it? This is about revenge.
Damon: The two aren't mutually exclusive.
Stefan: Damon, you can't do this.
Damon: Why not? They killed 27 people, and they called it a war battle. They deserve whatever they get.
Stefan: 27 vampires, Damon. They were vampires. You can't just bring them back.
Damon: This town deserves this.
Stefan: You're blaming innocent people for something that happened 145 years ago.
Damon: There is nothing innocent about these people, and don't think for a second it won't happen again. They already know too much, and they'll burn your little grandwitch right next to us when they find out. Trust me.
Bonnie and Emily: Things are different now.
Damon: Don't do this.
Bonnie and Emily: I can't free them. I won't. [chants] Incendia!
[The pentagram Emily carved into the dirt around her is set ablaze, and flames create a wall between Emily and Bonnie and Stefan, Damon and Elena.]

Damon: No! No please.
Elena: Bonnie!
Damon: No!
[Bonnie and Emily throws the necklace into the air, and it explodes above them. Once the spell is complete and the crystal is destroyed, Emily departs from Bonnie's body. Bonnie finally reawakens, and looks around in horror, having no idea what had just occurred. Damon is furious, and since his deal with Emily is off, he bites Bonnie and feeds on her. Elena yells in fear, and Stefan rushes over to pull Damon off of her. He kneels next to her and checks her pulse.]

Stefan: She's alive, but barely. I can save her.
[He bites into his wrist and dribbles his blood into Bonnie's mouth. Elena watches in shock as her wound closes up right before her eyes.]

Elena: Her neck, it's healing.
Forbes Residence
[Caroline is getting ready for bed, and is startled when she sees that Matt is crawling in through her bedroom.]

Matt: Hey.
Caroline: [annoyed] What are you doing here?
Matt: Your window was open. I thought you should know.
Caroline: Not funny.
Matt: [sighs] Earlier today, I lied.
Caroline: About?
Matt: About being in bed with you. We cuddled and it creeped me out.
Caroline: It creeped you out? I mean, did you just come over here to insult me or what? Because it's been a really long night--
Matt: --It's just that...I don't like you. I never have. But...it was nice.
Caroline: [confused] What?
Matt: Being in bed with you, it felt nice. And so, I was thinking about it, and I thought that I should tell you I stayed because you were all sad and alone and I felt bad for you.
Caroline: Well, thank you, 'cause I love being a charity case. You can leave now.
Matt: [flustered, and frustrated] No, because I know! With Vicki gone, and my mom off with Pete whoever, it's just me, so...I know.
Woods
[Stefan finally finds Damon sitting in the woods near the church ruins.]

Damon: Katherine never compelled me. I knew everything. Every step of the way. It was real for me. I'll leave now.
[Bonnie and Elena are standing near where Bonnie was attacked.]

Bonnie: I don't understand, Elena, what happened to me? He attacked me, and his face was like...
Elena: How do you feel? Are you okay?
Bonnie: I'm fine. It's just this blood. I don't...
[Stefan approaches the girls, and Bonnie immediately becomes frightened and weary of him.]

Stefan: I'm not gonna hurt you.
Bonnie: What's going on, Elena?
Elena: I'll explain everything, Bonnie. Okay? Let's just get out of here. Bonnie. Bonnie, look at me. Trust me. He's not going to hurt you. Come on. Come on.
[She leads Bonnie to her car, and then returns to talk to Stefan privately.]

Elena: Is she in danger of becoming...?
Stefan: No, she has to die with my blood in her system. So, keep an eye on her tonight and make sure that nothing happens, and once it leaves her system, she'll be fine.
Elena: I'm gonna tell her the truth.
Stefan: You sure?
Elena: I can trust her. I need someone to know, someone to talk to. I can't live in secret.
Stefan: You shouldn't have to.
Elena: You saved her life. I'm sorry, Stefan. I thought that I couldn't be with you, but I can. You don't have to push me away. I can do this. [She grabs his hands affectionately.]
Stefan: [pulls away from her] I can't. I have to leave, Elena. Too many people have died. Too much has happened.
Elena: What? No! I know you think you're protecting me, but...
Stefan: I have to. Coming home was...it was a mistake. I can't be a part of your life anymore.
Elena: Don't go Stefan. Please...You don't have to. This is your home. Please, don't go.
[Stefan kisses Elena's hand.]

Stefan: Good-bye, Elena.
Elena: You're just gonna walk away? Don't walk away, Stefan! Stefan! [She begins to cry.]
[Montage of multiple scenes: Jenna looks at the picture of her and Logan, and shreds it in pieces before throwing it away. Caroline returns to her room with her arms full of junk food. Matt helps her unload them, and they settle in in her bed. Damon sits on a the side of the knocked over wall of the church in the woods, his eyes wet with tears. Stefan sits on his bed with his journal on his lap, as though he's about to write, but after thinking about everything about Elena for a moment, he angrily throws the journal at his pillow on his bed then he begins to sob. Elena tells Bonnie everything about Stefan and Damon, and both of them cry.]

Gilbert Residence
[The doorbell rings, and Jenna opens the door to find Logan Fell standing on the porch.]

Logan: [smiles] Hello, Jenna.
Jenna: [shocked] Logan!
Logan: Aren't you gonna invite me in?

Gilbert Residence
[Logan Fell is standing outside on the porch. Jenna is talking to him from inside the front doorway.]

Jenna: Why are you here, Logan?
Logan: I missed you. I was out of town. I...
Jenna: Yeah, I got that email.
Logan: [shocked] You got an email?
Jenna: You didn't send an email?
Logan: I can explain. Just invite me in and I'll tell you everything.
Jenna: I'm not gonna invite you in. Forget it.
Logan: Come on, Jenna. It's me.
Jenna: The answer's no.
Logan: I know you. You're always one step from a maybe, a tiny nudge to yes.
Jenna: [scoffs] You just pointed out that I have no self-control. Clever strategy!
[Logan opens his mouth to say something, but Jenna slams the door in his face. Logan, clearly frustrated with the way their conversation went, walks to the edge of the porch. He sees a neighbor taking out the garbage. He walks down the porch steps and towards the man.]

Logan: Evening.
[The man gives him a polite wave and walks back towards his house. Logan walks down onto the sidewalk and watches the man leave. He breathes out heavily. Suddenly, a woman comes jogging around the corner. Logan turns around to looks at her. She stares at him as she jogs past him, but stops abruptly. Logan turns to face her again.]

Daphne: [walking towards Logan] Hey, you're that guy from the news, Logan Fell. I watch you every night. Well, I used to, I mean, you've been missing from my TV.
Logan: I took some time off.
Daphne: I noticed. I'm Daphne.
[She puts her hand out and he shakes it.]

Logan: Hey you know something, Daphne?
Daphne: No, what?
[Logan's eyes start to vamp out. Daphne screams as Logan goes in to bite her neck.]

[TITLE CARD]

[The next morning, Jeremy is up and reading his ancestor Johnathan Gilbert's journal.]

Jeremy: I live in fear. It consumes me. In the early evening when I see the sun begin to fade, the fear comes, because I know that the night brings death.
[Jeremy continues to flip through the pages of the journal. He finds a loose paper with a sketch drawn on it and becomes inspired. He pulls out an box from his closet and grabs an old sketchbook from it. He sets the box down and grabs a piece of charcoal. Flipping through the sketchbook, Jeremy sees all the old sketches he used to draw. He smiles at the memories and finally finds a blank page. He starts recreating the loose sketch from the journal. Elena walks out of her room and glances into Jeremy's room. She walks over to the doorway and sees Jeremy sketching. She smiles and quietly closes the door. Downstairs, Jenna is getting ready to leave. Elena comes down the stairs.]

Elena: Jeremy's got his sketch pad out.
Jenna: You're kidding?
Elena: Nope. But don't say a word. The minute we encourage him, he'll put it away.
Jenna: Psychology major. Check that!
[Elena looks at her phone.]

Jenna: You and Stefan? Update?
Elena: [buttoning up her jacket] He knows how I feel and where I stand and I know where he stands but it doesn't matter. He's leaving, moving away.
Jenna: Where is he going?
Elena: I've stopped asking questions. The answers get scary.
[Elena opens the front door and the pair walk out of the house.]

Jenna: Yours leaves, mine returns.
Elena: Logan?
Jenna: He's back. [Elena groans]  I didn't let him pass the front door.
Elena: I hope you slammed it in his face.
Jenna: Ah, medium slam.
Elena: Three-strike rule, Jenna. You're not even allowed to watch the news.
Jenna: Exactly. No more Logan Scum Fell.

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan walks into the parlor room where Damon is staring out the window.]

Stefan: So any idea of where you'll go?
Damon: I don't know. London, maybe. See some friends.
Stefan: You don't have any friends, Damon.
Damon: You're right, Stefan. I only have you. [turns away from the window] So, where are we goin'?
Stefan: We are not going anywhere. I'm gonna live my life as far away from you as possible.
Damon: [walking towards Stefan] But we're a team! We could travel the world together. We could try out for The Amazing Race.
Stefan: Mmmm, that's funny. Seriously, where are you going? Because we are not staying in this town.
[The doorbell rings. Damon and Stefan glance at the door and back at each other. Stefan leaves the parlor and opens the front door. Liz Forbes is outside.]

Sheriff Forbes: I'm here to see Damon.
Stefan: Uh, sure. Ok.
[Damon comes to the doorway.]

Damon: Sheriff. What a surprise.
Sheriff Forbes: Sorry to bother you, but we need to talk.
Damon: Come in.
[Liz enters the house. Damon shuts the door and leads Liz out into the back courtyard.]

Damon: Um, I hope you understand the secrecy. Stefan doesn't know about this yet and I'd like to keep it that way.
Sheriff Forbes: Of course, kids are too young to be brought into this.
Damon: So, what do you need?
Sheriff Forbes: There's been another attack. A female victim, her throat torn out, completely drained of blood. It fits the pattern.
Damon: I'm sorry. I don't understand. I thought we solved that problem when I [glances back]...staked the blond one.
Sheriff Forbes: I'm thinking she must have turned someone. Or multiple someones. I don't know.
[Inside the house, Stefan uses his vamp hearing to listen in to Liz and Damon's conversation.]

Sheriff Forbes: The story for the town is another animal attack but I'm not sure how long we can keep lying to them. The council is in an uproar. We thought we were past this.
Damon: So, uh, what do we do?
Sheriff Forbes: You're the only one who's ever taken on a vampire. We were hoping you could tell us.
Mystic Falls High School
[Caroline and Matt are walking together in the hallway.]

Matt: And then the ballet dancer and the Krumper did the salsa.
Caroline: Well, I was awake for that part.
Matt: Well, I don't know when you fell asleep. Umm, did you see the Celine Dion waltz about cancer?
Caroline: Those always make me cry!
Matt: Yeah, and then the loud judge kept screaming and I couldn't take it, so I turned it off.
[They stop walking and stand face to face with each other.]

Caroline: I sat through Family Guy. [poking Matt in the chest] So, you owe me.
[Elena and Bonnie are walking down the opposite end of the hall. They see Caroline and Matt together.]

Elena: Did I miss something?
Bonnie: They've been hanging out.
Elena: Kind of weird, don't you think?
[Caroline and Matt back away into their classroom.]

Bonnie: She needs someone nice like him, as opposed to a homicidal vampire like Damon.
Elena: Yeah, how are you doing with all that?
Bonnie: I'm freaked out. Damon attacked me. I could be dead right now. But I'm also grateful.
Elena: Hmm?
Bonnie: To Stefan. He saved my life and...Have you seen him?
[Elena removes her scarf and goes over to her locker.]

Elena: [throwing her scarf and bag in her locker.] Not since he told me he was leaving. For all I know, he's already gone.
Bonnie: He wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
Elena: [retrieving books from her locker] Yes, he would. He thinks he's protecting me. Clean break and all that.
Bonnie: So, what are you gonna do?
Elena: What am I supposed to do? I've already begged him not to go. If I ask again, I'm being selfish. It is what it is.
[They start to walk down the hallway again.]

Bonnie: Maybe it's for the best.
[Elena stops and looks at Bonnie who stops as well.]

Elena: What? Why?
Bonnie: I mean, what kind of future could you have had with him, even if he stayed?
[Suddenly, a banner falls down on them that says The Promise of your Future.]

Elena: Did you just...?
Bonnie: No, I swear.
[Elena sighs and hits the banner out of her way, storming off to her class.]

Elena: Oh, God.
[Bonnie walks after Elena.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon and Liz are at the front door. Stefan is sitting in the parlor, still listening to them.]

Damon: Thank you for stopping by.
Sheriff Forbes: Let me know what you come up with.
[Damon opens the front door for her.]

Damon: Absolutely.
[Liz exits and Damon shuts the front door. Stefan gets up and vamp speeds over to Damon. He grabs him by his shirt and holds him against the door.]

Stefan: What is wrong with you? You killed somebody?
Damon: Get off of me. [pushes Stefan off] A...don't touch me. B...if I had, I wouldn't have been so obvious about it. [walks past Stefan and turns around.]  C...There's another vampire in town.
Stefan: That's impossible.
Damon: Obviously not.
[Damon turns around and starts walking into the parlor.]

Stefan: Then, who could it be?
Damon: Ah, what do we care? We're leaving anyway, right?
Stefan: No, I can't leave now and you know that. [approaches Damon] How are we supposed to find this person?
Damon: Let the adults handle this, Stefan.
[Damon walks into the parlor, leaving Stefan in the front hallway, looking conflicted.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Elena and a friend part ways at the front of the school.]

Elena: See you later, ok?
Girl: Bye.
Elena: Bye.
[Elena continues to walk forward but stops abruptly when she sees Stefan sitting right in front of her on a table. She is shocked.]

Stefan: Hi. [Standing up] We need to talk.
[Elena nods, understandingly.]

[Tyler and Matt are playing basketball.]

Tyler: So, what's up with you and Forbes?
Matt: Nothing's up.
Tyler: I saw you two in the hall today. Don't even try to deny it, bro. You're tapping that.
Matt: No, it's not like that.
Tyler: Never is. Until you become we people.
[Tyler shoots the ball and scores a goal. Matt grabs the ball.]

Matt: We people?
Tyler: Yeah, we can't make it to the party; we'll never miss a game; we don't like the color red
Matt: We hung out, like, twice.
[Matt shoots a basket and scores. Tyler catches the ball.]

Tyler: Like I said, we.
[Elena and Stefan are sitting together on a table.]

Elena: So, you have no idea who it could be?
Stefan: None. But it must be somebody new because leaving a body like that, they're either sloppy or they're trying to send a message.
Elena: And you're sure it's not Damon?
Stefan: Well, I'm never sure about Damon, but he's been trying to keep a low profile lately, so it's just doesn't make any sense to me.
Elena: So what are you gonna do?
Stefan: Damon is tracking them right now. [Stands up and faces Elena.] Look, I promised you the truth so I wanted to tell you. I want you to be careful.
[Elena nods and stands up as well.]

Elena: When I saw you, I...thought you were coming to say goodbye.
Stefan: Not yet.
Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is sitting on the couch, sketching in his notebook. Jenna walks in and Jeremy shows her the sketch.]

Jeremy: Hey, what do you think?
Jenna: [pausing and looking at the sketch.] Creepy.
Jeremy: I found this old journal in dad's stuff, Johnathan Gilbert from the 1800s. He's kind of a freak show. [Jenna sits down on the back of the couch.] He wrote about demons and all of these people getting slaughter and...
Jenna: Yeah, he was a writer...short stories, horror stuff.
Jeremy: Oh, he wrote fiction? Figured he was just a lunatic or a drunk.
[Jenna gets up and grabs a book from a nearby shelf.]

Jenna: Well, he was a Gilbert, probably a little bit of both.
[Jeremy smiles. Jenna hands him the book she retrieved from the shelf.]

Warehouse
[Caroline is on the phone with Damon, holding the vampire compass.]

Caroline: So what do I do now?
Damon: Just wait. I'll be there in minute.
Caroline: Can you hurry? I have things to do.
[Suddenly, Damon appears behind Caroline. Caroline is startled by his sudden appearance.]

Damon: You can give me that.
[Caroline holds out the compass and Damon takes it.]

Caroline: So, why did you need me to do this?
Damon: Because I interfere with the signal.
Caroline: Can I go now? This has blown, like, half of my day.
Damon: You do that. [compelling Caroline] Get in your car. Go home. Forget I asked you to do this.
Caroline: [smiling] Ok. Bye now.
Damon: Bye.
[Caroline leaves. Damon turns to face the entrance of the warehouse. He walks up the steps and opens the door, entering the warehouse. Damon looks around as he walks deeper into the warehouse. Suddenly, Logan Fell shoots Damon multiple times. Damon groans in pain and falls on his knees to the floor. Logan approaches him.]

Logan: I have tons of these wood bullets, so nothing funky.
[Logan circles around Damon, holding out the gun.]

Damon: You don't wanna do this, trust me.
[Logan shoots Damon in the shoulder. Damon screams in pain.]

Logan: That's what you get.
Damon: For what?
Logan: [crouches down in front of Damon] You made me like this.
Damon: I killed you. I didn't turn you.
[Damon pries a bullet out from his chest. Logan holds up one of the wooden bullets and examines it.]

Logan: See I know what you and your brother are. I've been watching the two of you. I knew you'd show up here and I'm glad you did, because I have some questions.
Damon: [prying another bullet out] Me first. Who turned you?
Logan: [crouching down, face close to Damon's] How should I know? Last thing I remember is, I'm about to stake your brother and then you grabbed me. That's it! Until I wake up in the ground behind a used car dealership on highway 4. Somebody buried me.
Damon: It happens. [prying a bullet out of his leg] Ow.
Logan: You bit me.
Damon: [examining the wooden bullet he just extracted from his leg] Damn it.
Logan: It had to be you.
Damon: You have to have vampire blood in your system when you die. I didn't do that. Some other vampire found you, gave you their blood.
[Damon groans and falls back onto the floor.]

Logan: Who?
Damon: That's what I wanna know.
Logan: Dude, it's not like the welcome wagon was waiting with a bundt cake and a handbook. It's been a learn as you go process. You know, one minute, I'm a small town on the rise news guy and next thing I know, I can't get into my house, because my foot won't go through the door.
Damon: [sitting up and prying another bullet out] You have to be invited in.
Logan: I know. I live alone.
Damon: Ah, [chuckles softly] that sucks.
Logan: So now, I am at the Ramada, watching pay per view all day, eating everything in sight, including housekeeping.
Damon: It could be worse.
Logan: All I can think about is blood and killing people. I can't stop killing people. I keep killing [laughs maniacally] and I like it. I'm conflicted.
Damon: Welcome to the club.
[Logan stands up.]

Damon: Wait a minute. Cops only found one body.
Logan: I left one. I was tired. But I've been hiding the rest of bodies. They're right back there.
[Logan points to the bodies with his gun. Damon looks over.]

Damon: You're kidding.
Logan: They're just piling up!
Mystic Falls High School
[The career fair is in full swing at the school. Liz walks into the main room in full uniform. Richard walks up next to her.]

Mayor Lockwood: So what do we know?
Sheriff Forbes: Nothing new to report yet. [Richard groans.] My highly reliable deputies are all on alert, but if you feel the need to be more proactive, by all means, grab a stake and have at it.
Mayor Lockwood: [grabbing a coffee cup] What extra precautions can we take?
Sheriff Forbes: For right now, there is nowhere safer than a crowded public place, and for once, Mayor, we actually know where our kids are.
[Tyler is flipping through some sketches in a giant notebook. Jeremy walks in and looks over at Tyler. Tyler looks up.]

Tyler: What do you want?
Jeremy: Hey. Uh, I'm just surprised to see you here. [walks towards Tyler] Art usually implies culture and culture implies, well, not you.
Tyler: Go to hell.
[Jeremy smirks and looks down at the drawing Tyler stopped on. Tyler is the one who drew it.]

[Elena approaches Matt.]

Elena: Still wanna be an astronaut?
Matt: I can't believe you remember that.
Elena: I can remember the tinfoil that you wore on your head.
Matt: I was eight.
Elena: How are you doing?
Matt: I've had it easier. You? I heard some things. [Caroline enters the room and sees Matt talking to Elena.] So it's true that you and Stefan...
Elena: Yeah, it is.
[Caroline exits the room quickly. Clearly upset.]

Elena: What about you, Matt Donovan? I heard about Caroline.
Matt: Aw, man, not you too.
Elena: Hey.
Matt: We're friends. [Elena looks up at him, skeptically.] It's not a big deal.
Elena: No?
Matt: No.
[Matt and Elena stare at each other for a moment. Elena turns her head and sees Stefan standing in the doorway. The pair look at each other and Matt looks at Stefan, clearly jealous.]

Warehouse
Logan: Why am I so overly emotional? All I can think about is my ex-girlfriend. I wanna be with her and bite her and stuff.
Damon: Well, you probably love her. Anything you felt before will be magnified now. You're gonna have to learn how to control that.
Logan: What about walking in the sun? I'm a morning person. You can walk in the sun which, by the way, is pretty cool. [Damon flexes his hand with the daylight ring on it and hides it with his other hand.] The council will never suspect you. That's not in the journals.
Damon: The journals?
Logan: Yeah, the founding fathers, they passed down journals to their kids. Come on man, you gotta tell me. How can you walk around in the sun?
Damon: Who turned you?
Logan: How do you walk in the sun?
Damon: Who turned you?
Logan: You know, I've been really nice so far but I will kill you.
[Logan stands up and points the gun at Damon.]

Damon: Then you'll never know. [Damon stands up.] You're not answering my question.
Logan: You first!
Damon: It seems we're at a bit of an impasse then, doesn't it?
Logan: I have things to do, people to kill. Guess I'll be needing a little head start.
[Logan shoots Damon a couple of times. Damon groans and falls to the floor while Logan exits the warehouse.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Elena and Stefan are leaning against a wall, facing each other.]

Elena: I'm guessing you're not here to plan the path for your future. [pauses] You're looking out for me.
Stefan: Hope that's ok.
[Elena doesn't respond and walks over to a table, looking at the career pamphlets set up. Stefan walks over to her.]

Stefan: You know I wanted to be a doctor before everything happened, but, uh, then I couldn't, 'cause...
Elena: The blood.
Stefan: Yeah. I've dabbled in a bunch of different things, though.
Elena: Didn't love anything enough to stick to it?
[Elena moves on to the next booth with Stefan right behind her.]

Stefan: No, I...I loved it all. I just...I had to move on before anybody could notice that I wasn't getting any older.
Elena: How long before that would happen?
Stefan: Few years, usually. Sometimes shorter.
Elena: [finally looking up at him] And you always left?
Stefan: I didn't have a choice.
[Elena looks away.]

Stefan: [smiling] So, what about...what about you? What are your, uh, plans for the future?
Elena: [looks up at Stefan, frustratingly speaks] I don't wanna talk about my future, Stefan. Because everything you're saying is making it perfectly clear that you're not gonna be in.
Stefan: Elena, it's not that I don't wanna be in it.
Elena: You can't, I get it. I heard you the first time and the second time, and I appreciate you looking out for me but, please, if you're gonna leave, then just go.
[Jenna walks into the room and approaches Elena and Stefan.]

Jenna: Hide me.
Elena: What's going on?
Jenna: The scum Fell has landed.
Elena: Logan's here.
Stefan: [surprised] Wait, Logan Fell?
[Jenna nods. Stefan goes out into the hall and spots Logan. Logan looks over at him and waves. Elena walks out into the hallway to talk to Stefan.]

Elena: Stefan, what's going on?
[Logan approaches the pair as well as Jenna, who comes out of the classroom after Elena.]

Logan: Jenna, are you dodging me?
Jenna: It's a form of self-preservation.
Stefan: Um, Elena, why don't you and Jenna go somewhere else?
[Stefan looks at Elena, significantly. Elena looks at him, understandingly.]

Elena: Let's go.
[Elena grabs Jenna's hand and leads her away from Logan and Stefan, quickly. Logan watches them leave and turns to face Stefan.]

Stefan: What are you doing here?
Logan: You know, your brother asked me the same thing. In fact, why don't we just skip past all that who turned me stuff and get the answer that I want? How can I turn into a day walker?
Stefan: Damon and I are the only two that I know of.
Logan: But you're both very cagey on the how, which tells me that there is a way. You know, in case you hadn't noticed, I'm quite the celebrity in this town. It would be very, very easy for me to expose you.
Stefan: You wanna know how you can walk around in the sun?
Logan: I do.
Stefan: You can't. Don't ever threaten me again.
[Stefan walks past Logan.]

[Elena and Jenna stop in another part of the school. Elena faces Jenna.]

Elena: When Logan came to the house, what did he say?
Jenna: Fake flattery. Stupid, dimpled grin. Puppy dog eyes.
Elena: I'm serious, Jenna. How did he act? What did he say?
Jenna: He was the usual Logan, was charming, a little more manic than usual. He kept trying to convince me to let him in. [Elena looks up at her.] What?
Elena: Ok, listen to me very carefully. Do not, under any circumstances, talk to him again. I'm serious, Jenna, like ever!
[Alaric enter the room.]

Alaric: Hey Elena. Jenna
Elena: Hi Mr. Saltzman.
Alaric: [to Jenna] Yeah, I was hoping to see you tonight.
Jenna: Career night is the new bowling.
[Alaric laughs.]

Elena: Ok, um, excuse me.
[Elena leaves]

[Stefan is outside of the school, talking to Damon on the phone, who is back at the Salvatore Boarding House.]

Damon: Logan Fell is a vampire and when I find him again, I'm gonna destroy him limb by limb.
[Elena exits the school and looks around for Stefan. Stefan sees her but doesn't acknowledge her.]

Stefan: [to Damon] What happened? Are you ok?
[Elena spots Stefan leaning against the railing.]

Damon: No, I'm not ok. I was ambushed. I was shot. [Standing in front of a mirror, taking his shirt off.] Now, I'm vengeful. Just got to find him.
Stefan: Well, there's no need. He's here at the school.
Damon: You're kidding me. Why the hell is he there?
Stefan: He's working the crowd.
Damon: Well, I'll be right there.
[Elena approaches Stefan as he hangs up his phone.]

Elena: [crossing her arms over her chest] So. Anything you'd like to share?
[Caroline leads Liz to a booth at the Career Fair.]

Sheriff Forbes: What are you doing?
Caroline: Following my future. [They approach a booth and Caroline points to the banner.] There it is.
Sheriff Forbes: Broadcast journalism?
Caroline: Yes. Broadcast journalism. [Liz looks at her skeptically] Why are you looking at me like that?
Sheriff Forbes: You don't even read the paper.
[Caroline walks out angrily without a word. Liz pursues her, but Logan comes up from behind her.]

Logan: Liz.
Sheriff Forbes: [surprised] Logan.
[Liz starts to pull out her gun.]

Logan: What are you gonna do stake me? Bury me in another shallow grave? What would the email say this time?
Sheriff Forbes: I didn't have a choice.
Logan: [moves threateningly towards Liz] You bitch! I died for you, for this town. You've known me since I was six and you swept me under the rug like dirt.
Sheriff Forbes: You knew what you were getting into.
Logan: I was one of you.
Sheriff Forbes: And now you're one of them.
[Logan starts to leave, but turns around and whispers into Liz's ear.]

Logan: Watch your back, Sheriff.
[Logan smiles and finally leaves. Liz phones her deputies.]

Sheriff Forbes: Get a backup team to the school immediately. Keep it within the circle. It's a V5.
[She hangs up quickly.]

[In the school hall, Jeremy approaches Tyler.]

Jeremy: I didn't know you drew.
Tyler: It's an elective.
Jeremy: Because it's good stuff. You like graphics? Cause that's, uh, that's kind of my thing.
Tyler: [stopping] Woah, whoa, what are you doing?
Jeremy: [stops and faces Tyler] Well, it's just something else we have in common.
Tyler: What's the other thing? Vicki? Let's hang out because we did the same chick? Go be friends with one of the many other guys that she screwed, there is no shortage of them.
[Jeremy and Tyler start fighting. Alaric and Mayor Lockwood break them up.]

Alaric: [to Jeremy] Alright, work it out, tough guy.
Mayor Lockwood: You two, follow me.
[Jeremy and Tyler follow the Mayor.]

Alaric: Excuse me, Mayor. [They all stop and face Alaric.] Where are you taking them?
Mayor Lockwood: I'm gonna talk to them. All fights should end in handshakes, don't you think? [Turns back to Tyler and Jeremy.] Come on.
[Caroline is outside of the school, leaving a message for Bonnie on her phone.]

Caroline: Bonnie, where are you? I'm ready to go. I'll be outside.
[Caroline hangs up her phone. Logan pulls up next to Caroline in an SUV.]

Logan: Hey, damsel in distress, need a ride?
Caroline: [sarcastically] Oh my God. Logan Fell, channel 9, is that you? [fake gasps]
Logan: I used to baby sit you, Caroline Forbes. Don't mock me.
Caroline: Well, I was supposed to go home with Bonnie, but I can't find her.
Logan: It's not a problem, really. It's on my way.
Caroline: Okay.
[Caroline gets in the car. Matt sees her get in.]

Caroline: You know, this is fate.
Logan: And why is that?
Caroline: Because I'm interested in broadcast journalism. So can I ask you a couple questions?
Logan: Anything you want. But first, buckle up.
Caroline: Ok.
[Caroline reaches around for her seatbelt when Logan slams her head against the window, leaving a blood smear on the glass and knocking her unconscious.]

[Stefan and Elena are walking down the hallway. Matt walks in the opposite direction.]

Matt: Hey.
Elena: [stopping Matt] Hey, have you seen Logan Fell, the news guy?
Matt: Yeah. He just gave Caroline a ride home.
[Matt walks away. Elena looks at Stefan. Stefan starts to walk away.]

Stefan: Stay here.
[Elena watches Stefan leave with a look of anguish on her face.]

[Outside the school, Mayor Lockwood escorts Jeremy and Tyler to a secluded area.]

Mayor Lockwood: Ok, let's get this out of your system. Go ahead. Fight.
Jeremy: You want us to what?
Tyler: I'm not gonna fight him, dad.
Jeremy: I don't think so, sir.
[Jeremy attempts to leave, but the Mayor blocks his way.]

Mayor Lockwood: You don't fight in there like pansies. You take it outside, fight your battles like men, and move on. Best lesson my dad taught me. So let's settle it. Fight.
[Alaric walks out the back entrance and sees the group of men.]

Tyler: Come on, dad.
Jeremy: That's not gonna happen.
Mayor Lockwood: I said fight!
[Tyler tries to leave, his dad pushes him into Jeremy. Alaric approaches them.]

Alaric: Whoa. What's going on out here?
Mayor Lockwood: Just letting these two kids work it out. We're good here. Go back inside.
Alaric: I don't wanna go back inside. What I want is an answer to my question. What's going on out here?
Mayor Lockwood: Who do you think you're talking to? Do I look like a student?
Alaric: No. You look like a full grown alpha male douchebag.
[Jeremy smirks, Tyler looks shocked that Alaric had the guts to say such a thing.]

Mayor Lockwood: You don't talk to me like that. I can have your job like this. [Snaps his fingers.]
Alaric: Ah, you do that. Then it will be you and me in this parking lot, working things out. You cool with that?
Mayor Lockwood: You just marked yourself.
Alaric: Ok.
[Richard looks back at Tyler who starts walking away. Richard follows him. Jeremy is trying to contain a smile. Alaric looks over at him.]

Alaric: [to Jeremy] You all right?
[Jeremy nods, still suppressing a smirk.]

Mystic Falls
[Sheriff Forbes is driving in her car. Her phone rings and she answers it.]

Sheriff Forbes: Where are you?
Logan: Your daughter has expressed an interest in journalism. I think it's important to foster young minds.
Sheriff Forbes: What do you want?
Logan: The satisfaction of turning your daughter into a vampire.
[Logan stops at an intersection. Suddenly, Stefan vamp speeds at the car and pulls Logan out of the car, throwing him to the pavement. Logan gets up and Damon comes out of the woods, shooting a gun at Logan, who falls to the pavement.]

Damon: Payback's a bitch, isn't it? [to Stefan] Get her out of here.
[Stefan goes around to the passenger's side to retrieve Caroline.]

Sheriff Forbes [on the phone]: Logan, what happened?! Logan?
[Damon jogs over to the car and picks up Logan's phone.]

Damon [phone]: Sheriff, yeah, it's Damon.
Sheriff Forbes [phone]: Where is Caroline?
[Stefan grabs Caroline and vamp speeds out of the area.]

Damon [phone]: She's ok. I'm on Elm Street.
[Damon hangs up the phone and opens Logan's trunk. He grabs a tire iron.]

Damon: Gonna try this one more time. [swings the tire iron, indicating that he will harm Logan] Who turned you?
Logan: I told you I don't know.
Damon: [examining the tire iron] This tire iron here could take your head clean off. [holds the tire iron in a swinging position] Is that your final answer?
Logan: How can you side with them?
Damon: I don't side with anyone. You pissed me off. I want you dead. Who turned you?
Logan: I don't know!
Damon: Oh, well. You're screwed.
[Damon starts to swing the tire iron towards Logan's head.]

Logan: Wait, wait! I do know.
Damon: You're lying.
Logan: You think you're the only one who wants to get in that tomb underneath the old church?
Damon: If you're lying to me, I will end you.
Logan: I am not lying. There is another way to break the spell. We can help you. Meet me at the old church.
[Sirens are heard in the distance]

Damon: Take me down. Make it look real. Make it look real!
[Logan throws Damon against his car and vamp speeds off. Sheriff Forbes gets out of her car.]

Sheriff Forbes: Where is she?
Damon: She's ok. My brother's taken her home. I'm sorry, Sheriff. I just wasn't strong enough.
Mystic Falls High School
[Stefan enters the school and stands at the end of a hallway looking over at Elena. Elena is speaking to a friend and tells her bye when she sees Stefan. She quickly walks over to him.]

Elena: Caroline?
[The two walk a short distance away and stop.]

Stefan: Shes ok. I took her home. She was shaken up. But all she knows is Logan attacked her. Nothing else.
Elena: Where's Logan?
Stefan: Damon's dealing with him.
Elena: As in...?
[Stefan nods.]

Stefan: You saw what happened tonight, right? [Elena touches Stefan's arm to soothe him. Stefan crosses his arms over his chest and she retracts her hand.] I mean, you understand why we can't be together? You see it?
Elena: Yeah, I'm starting to see a lot of things, Stefan. Come on. I'll, uh, I'll give you a ride.
Stefan: Uh, I can get home.
Elena: I know.
Stefan: All right. That'd be nice.
[Elena and Stefan leave together.]

[Outside. Jeremy approaches Tyler, who is sitting alone.]

Jeremy: Hey.
Tyler: What do you want?
[Tyler gets up and walks towards Jeremy.]

Jeremy: I don't know. I, uh, I thought that was weird with your dad, what he did. Is he like that all the time? Is that...Is that what you gotta go through? Man, I...I get it. I get it. [Tyler hits him.] What's your problem?
Tyler: Look, I don't need your pity.
Jeremy: Seriously, you don't have to be like this. You don't.
Tyler: Just go.
[Jeremy starts to back away.]

Jeremy: What is your problem, man?
Tyler: I don't know, ok? I don't know.
[The shot pulls out to reveal a full moon.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena and Stefan pull up to the driveway. Elena turns the car off, but they remain in the car.]

Elena: What I said before about you leaving. It was harsh.
Stefan: No, no. You had every right.
Elena: You asked me what I wanted my future to be. I wanted to be a writer. My mom sort of push me into that direction from the time I was able to read. She supported me, encouraged me, bought me my first journal, and then she died. And I can't see myself being a writer anymore. That was something that we shared. I know that you think you put all of this bad stuff into my life, but my life already had it. I was buried in it.
Stefan: This is different.
Elena: It doesn't make it any less painful.
Stefan: I know that it's...that's it's hard to understand, but I'm doing this for you.
[Stefan gets out of the car. Elena remains in the car for a moment, but eventually gets out. Stefan walks up the driveway towards the house.]

Elena: No.
[Stefan stops.]

Elena: You don't get to make that decision for me. If you walk away, it's for you, because I know what I want. Stefan, I love you.
[Stefan still has his back towards Elena. Elena waits for a moment, tears sparkling in her eyes, afraid that Stefan will walk away. Stefan finally turns around with tears in his eyes. He quickly walks over towards Elena, grabs her face in his hands and kisses her with passion. As they continue kissing Stefan has Elena against the wall for a second as they make their way into the front room of the Salvatore house. Elena removes her scarf and tosses it to the floor. Elena runs her hands through his hair and Stefan holds her face to his as they continue to kiss. Suddenly, Stefan feels his eyes changing and he stops kissing her. Elena breathes heavily as Stefan rests his head on her shoulder. Stefan, also breathing heavily, finally pulls away and turns around so Elena cannot see his vampire face. Elena tries to pull him back to face her.]

Elena: Don't.
Stefan: Elena, I can't...
Elena: Yes, you can. [She touches his face.] Don't hide from me.
[Stefan turns his face towards hers. Elena still has her hand on his cheek. Stefan's eyes are red and the veins still crawl towards his eyes. Elena looks at him with no fear. She gently touches the veins around his eyes Stefan feels a little more under control with his urge to feed on her, Elena then kisses him. When she pulls away,he pulls her back for another kiss before Stefan's face has becomes normal again. Elena smiles and takes Stefan's hand. She leads Stefan up to his bedroom. They stop on the landing and begin to kiss passionately. They, eventually make it to Stefan's bedroom where Stefan beings removing his and Elena's clothes while touching each others bodies. Stefan then gently lowers Elena onto the bed and they continue to kiss with intense passion. Stefan and Elena's hands intertwine as they start to make love. Elena explores the muscles on Stefan's back and traces her finger against his lip while Stefan kisses her neck and touches one side of her cheek. Elena's face shows nothing but pleasure as the two have sex for the first time together.]

Warehouse
[Logan exits the warehouse. He walks to his car but hears a loud clang from behind him. He turns around to investigate and when he turns back towards his car, Alaric is blocking his way. Logan backs up.]

Logan: Who are you?
Alaric: A friend of Jenna's.
Logan: Jenna sent you?
Alaric: No, I came on my own.
Logan: Ah, I get it. Well, buddy, I know you think this makes you brave. But actually it makes you pretty stupid.
Alaric: Either way, here I am.
Logan: What do you want?
Alaric: Jenna is a good person. She deserves the best. I'm here to make sure she gets it.
Logan: Was that supposed to be a threat? Couldn't you throw a punch? Maybe provoke me a little?
Alaric: I'm not a violent guy by design.
Logan: Well, you're not a very smart one, either.
Alaric: How's that?
[Logan turns his back to Alaric. Alaric slowly takes the hidden stake out from inside the sleeve of his jacket.]

Logan: 'Cause you have no idea who you're talking to.
[Logan starts to vamp out. He turns around and goes to attack Alaric. Alaric, who knew Logan was a vampire and was expecting to be attacked, stakes Logan. Logan falls to the ground dead. Alaric looks shocked at what he was capable of and quickly gets out of there.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Tyler is leaning against Matt's truck. Matt approaches him.]

Tyler: I need a ride
Matt: Sure.
[Tyler goes towards the passenger's door.]

Matt: Look, I like Caroline. [Tyler stops and looks at him] She's got this thing....this way about her....and I like her ok? And I'm not gonna defend it or apologize about.
Tyler: Ok.
Matt: So stop your little bromance bitch act.
Tyler: [calmly] Ok.
[Matt walks over to the driver's side and gets in. Tyler gets in the other side shortly after.]

Forbes Residence
[Caroline is asleep in her bed. Liz strokes her hair as she watches her sleep. Liz's phone goes off and she leaves the room to answer it.]

Sheriff Forbes: Yeah, I'll be right there.
[She hangs up and quietly closes Caroline's door.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is holding Elena in his arms and stroking her hair. Elena is wearing Stefan's shirt and looking around the room from the comfort of Stefan's arms.]

Elena: I've never been in your room before.
Stefan: Hm, well, it hasn't changed much over the years.
Elena: Do you leave everything here when you come and go?
Stefan: It's the only place that...that has remained constant. This room holds every memory that I've ever thought was important enough to hold on to.
[Elena smiles and snuggles into Stefan's chest. Stefan kisses her head.]

Elena: A lot of memories.
[Elena looks up at him. Stefan kisses her forehead.]

Stefan: Yep. Are you thirsty or anything?
Elena: A little. You? Uh...[Stefan laughs.]
Stefan: I'm fine. Let me get you something to drink, ok?
Elena: Ok.
[They kiss. Stefan gets up and leaves the room. Elena snuggles up against a pillow and smiles brightly. Soon she gets up and starts exploring Stefan's room. Elena finally comes across the picture of Katherine. She picks it up and sees they resemblance. Teary eyed, Elena puts the picture down and leaves.]

Old Church
[Damon is pacing around, waiting for Logan. His phone rings and he answers it.]

Damon: Hello.
[Liz is on the other end. She is outside of the warehouse.]

Sheriff Forbes: I just wanted to say thank you. I don't know how you did it.
Damon: Um, not following.
Sheriff Forbes: We found Logan's body up by the old Fell warehouse. He has been disposed of. He was hoarding victims, innocent victims.
Damon: What?
Sheriff Forbes: This town owes you so much. So do I.
[Liz quickly hangs up. Damon looks completely and utterly shocked.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan comes back in his room with a glass of water.]

Stefan: Elena?
[He sees the picture of Katherine and Elena's necklace on top of it. He picks up the necklace and the picture. He looks around, worried.]

Mystic Falls
[Elena is driving down a deserted road, crying. She sees someone in the middle of the road. She slams her brakes, but the person hits her windshield. Her car flips. She is stuck in her seat, the man who she hit slowly gets back up and starts to approach her.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[In his room, Stefan is holding the picture of Katherine and the necklace. He tries to call Elena, but with no answer, leaves her another voicemail.]

Stefan: Elena. It's Stefan. I know that this picture must have confused you. But I can explain. I need to explain. So, please, when you get this, call me.

Mystic Falls
[Elena is driving her car and sees a man in the middle of the road. She slams on her brakes but hits the man. Her car rolls over and over. She is stuck in her seat. The man somehow recovers and starts walking towards her car. Elena screams. The man runs away. A second later, Damon appears.]

Elena: Ah!
Damon: How ya doing in there?
Elena: Damon?
Damon: You look stuck.
Elena: It's my seat belt. I can't get it.
Damon: Shh Shh Shh. Let me get you out of there. I want you to put your hands on the roof. Just like that. You ready? 1, 2, 3. [Damon ejects her seat belt.] I got you. [Damon picks up Elena.] Are you okay? Can you stand? Is anything broken?
Elena: Uh-uh.
[Damon puts Elena down but she can barely stand. Damon catches her before she falls to the ground.]

Damon: Whoa, you're fading fast, Elena. Elena, look at me. [Damon grabs her face.] Focus. Look at me. Okay.
Elena: I look like her...
Damon: What?
[Elena faints. Damon grabs her and slowly puts her on the ground. He brushes her face with his hand.]

Damon: Upsy-daisy.
[Damon picks her up and carries her away.]

Alaric's Apartment
Alaric [typing on his computer]: I found one. After years of research and study, there it was right in front of me. I was terrified. As I stared it in the eyes, I drove a stake through its heart. I was right about Mystic Falls. There is evil here. I can sense it. Feel it. It's everywhere.
[Alaric looks at a photo of a young woman.]

Flashback
[Alaric kisses Isobel on the forehead. She wakes up.]

Isobel: [Sleepily] Ohhh. It's not even seven yet.
Alaric: Which means you shouldn't be awake for at least six hours.
Isobel: [Smiles] I hate morning people.
Alaric: I'm going to be home late.
Isobel: I love you.
Alaric: I love you too.
Somewhere In Georgia
[In Damon's car. Elena wakes up.]

Damon: Morning.
Elena: Where are we?
Damon: Georgia.
Elena: Georgia? No, no. No, we're not. Seriously, Damon. Where are we?
Damon: Seriously, we're...we're in Georgia. How ya feeling?
Elena: I...I...
Damon: There's no broken bones. I checked.
Elena: But my car...there was a man...I hit a man. But then he got up, and...who was that?
Damon: That's what I would like to know.
Elena: Where is my phone? OK. We really need to go back. Nobody knows where I am. Pull over. I mean it, Damon. Pull over! Stop the car!
Damon: Oh you were so much more fun when you were asleep.
[Damon pulls over. Elena gets out of the car, she limps weakly and Damon rushes over to her to help her.]

Damon: [crouching down by her for support] Hey.
Elena: [looking at Damon strangely] I'm fine. We have to go back.
Damon: Oh come on. Look. We've already come this far...
Elena: Why are you doing this? I can't be in Georgia. I wrecked my car. I have to go home. This is kidnapping.
Damon: That's a little melodramatic, don't you think?
Elena: You're not funny. You can't do this. I'm not going to Georgia.
Damon: Well, you're IN Georgia. Without your magical little necklace, I might add. I can very easily make you...agreeable.
Elena: What are you trying to prove?
[Elena's cell phone rings.]

Elena: That's my phone.
Damon: Mmm. It's your boyfriend. I'll take it. [He speaks into the phone.] Elena's phone...!
Stefan: Where is she? Why do you have her phone? Is she okay?
Damon: Elena? She's right here. And, yes, she's fine.
Stefan: Where are you? Let me speak to her.
Damon: He wants to talk to you.
Elena: [Shaking her head] Uh-uh.
Damon: Yeah. I don't...I don't really think she wants to talk to you right now.
Stefan: Damon, I swear to God, if you touch her...
Damon: [smirks] You have a good day. Mm-hmm. Bye-now.
Stefan: Argh!
Elena [to Damon]: Look, no one knows where I am. Can we please just go back?
Damon: We're almost there.
Elena: Where is there?!
Damon: A little place right outside of Atlanta. Oh, come on, Elena. You don't wanna go back right now. Do you? What's the rush? Time-out. Trust me. Your problems are still going to be there when you get home. Look. Step away from your life for five minutes. Five minutes!
Elena: Am I gonna be safe with you?
Damon: Yes.
Elena: You promise not to do that mind control thing with me?
Damon: Yes.
Elena: Can I trust you?
Damon: Get in the car. Come on.
Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric is at his car in the parking lot, searching for something in the seats. Jeremy sees him.]

Jeremy: Hey, Mr. Saltzman!
Alaric: Hey, Jeremy. I, uh...can't find my ring. I took it off for the gym, and thought I put it...there it is! Losing family heirlooms...bad. How's your extra credit coming? You pick a topic yet?
Jeremy: Mystic Falls, the Civil War era.
Alaric: What's the angle?
Jeremy: My family. I found a journal of an ancestor who lived in the 1800s. And the Gilberts were one of the original Founding Families of Mystic Falls. So...
Alaric: That sounds good.
[Stefan sees Bonnie and goes over to her.]

Stefan: Bonnie.
Bonnie: Stefan...
Stefan: Hey.
Bonnie: Hi.
Stefan: I haven't seen you lately. How are you doing with everything?
Bonnie: I'm fine. It's all fine.
Stefan: Good. Yeah.
Bonnie: Are you back in school?
Stefan: No. Actually I came here to find you. I was hoping you could help me with something. A spell.
Bonnie: Stefan, look, I know Elena's okay with all of this, and I appreciate what you did to help me. But I'm not really ready to dive into it with you just yet.
Stefan: I understand that. But I need your help. It's Elena. She's with Damon. I have Elena's necklace. I was just hoping you could use this to make some sort of a connection. I just need to know that she's okay.
Bonnie: How do you know I can do this?
Stefan: Because I've known a few witches over the years. I've seen what they can do.
Bonnie: I'm still new at it.
Stefan: It's okay. Give it a shot.
Bonnie: Okay. All right.
[Bonnie takes the necklace and closes her eyes trying to make something happen.]

Bonnie: There's nothing. Nothing's happening. Usually there's an image or...tell me if anyone's looking.
Stefan: Okay.
[Bonnie picks up a leaf and tries to make it float. It doesn't work.]

Stefan: What is it?
Bonnie: Something's wrong.
Stefan: With Elena?
Bonnie: With me. There's something wrong with me. [grabs her things] I have to go. I'm sorry, Stefan. I can't help you. [Bonnie walks away quickly, while Stefan watches her.]
Georgia
[In Damon's car.]

Elena: So, where's my car?
Damon: I pulled it off to the side of the road. I don't think anyone will bother it.
Elena: What about that man in the road? Was he a...?
Damon: From what I could tell, yeah...
Elena: You didn't know him?
Damon: If I've never met him, I wouldn't know him. I mean, it's not like we all hang out together at the Vamp Bar and Grill.
Bree's Bar
[Damon pulls up in front of a bar named Bree's Bar.]

Elena: Where are we? You brought me to a bar? Damon, I'm not old enough. They're not going to let me in.
Damon: Sure they will.
[They get out of the car and enter the bar.]

Bree: No. No, it can't be. Damon. My honey pie.
[Bree grabs Damon's face and kisses him.]

Bree: [shouting] Listen up everybody! Here's to the man that broke my heart, crushed my soul, destroyed my life, and ruined any and all chances of happiness! [Bree pours shots for everyone.] Drink up! [Damon and Bree shoot their alcohol.] Ahh. Whoo! [to Elena] So, how'd he rope you in? [She pours Elena a shot.]
Elena: I'm not roped in. Actually, I'm dating his...
Bree: Honey, if you're not roped, you're whipped. Either way, just enjoy the ride. [smiles and pours more alcohol.]
Elena: Okay. So, how did you two meet?
Bree: College.
Elena [to Damon]: You went to college?
Damon: [smiling] I've been on a college campus, yes.
Bree: About twenty years ago, when I was a sweet, young freshman, I met this beautiful man, and I fell in love. And then he told me about his little secret, made me love him more. Because, you see, I had a little secret of my own that I was dying to share with somebody.
Damon [whispering to Elena]: She's a witch.
Bree: Changed my world, you know.
Damon: [smirking] I rocked your world.
Bree: He is good in the sack, isn't he? But mostly he's just a Walk-Away Joe. [to Damon] So, what is it that you want?
Mystic Falls Library
[Jeremy is at the library, looking for a book. Suddenly, some books fall down in front of him. A girl appears from the other side of the bookshelf.]

Anna: Oh my god. I am so sorry. There was this one book wedged between the other, and so I pulled and then kaplunk, kaboom. [gesturing with her hands] Are you ok?
Jeremy: Yeah, I'm fine.
[They both kneel down to pick up the books at the same time and knock into each other's heads.]

Anna: [grabs her head] Ahh! I'm Anna.
Jeremy: [rubs his own head and laughs] I'm Jeremy.
Gram's Residence
[Bonnie is looking through old spellbooks, when her Grams enters.]

Bonnie: Thank God you're back.
Grams: And hello to you, too. What's the matter?
Bonnie: My powers are gone, Grams. I can't do anything, even when I concentrate. And there's nothing in in any of these books that can tell me how to get them back.
Grams: Hang on, now. Just calm down. Tell me what happened.
Bonnie: I can't.
Grams: We keeping secrets now?
Bonnie: I have to. I'm sorry. I promised. Please, help me.
Grams: Well, first of all, there's nothing in any of these that's gonna help you. If you're blocked, it's in here. [points to Bonnie's head] You gotta clear it out, then you're back in business.
Bonnie: Clear what out?
Grams: Whatever's got you so scared.
Bree's Bar
[Elena is out by Damon's car. She calls Jenna.]

Elena: Hi, Jenna. I'm so sorry.
Jenna: Where are you? Why didn't you call?
Elena: I was so tired last night. I fell asleep at Bonnie's. And then this morning, I just wanted to get to school.
Jenna: Are you okay?
Elena: You know, Stefan and stuff.
[Inside the bar.]

Damon: [to Bree] Come on, there's gotta be another way.
Bree: After all these years, it's still only Katherine. How do you even know she's still alive?
Damon: Well, you help me get into that tomb, and we'll find out.
Bree: I already did. Twenty years ago. Remember? Three easy steps: Comet. Crystal. Spell.
Damon: There's a little problem with number two. I don't have the crystal.
Bree: That's it, Damon. There is no other way. It's Emily's spell.
Damon: What about a new spell with a new crystal that overrides Emily's spell?
Bree: It doesn't work that way, baby. Emily's spell is absolute. You can't get into that tomb.
Fell's Church Ruins
[Bonnie is at the old Fell's Church, where Emily destroyed the crystal and Damon attacked Bonnie.]

Bonnie: [hears a noise] Hello? Anybody here?! Aah!
[The ground below her feet gives away and Bonnie falls into a hole.]

Bree's Bar
[Elena is still outside. Her phone rings. She answers it.]

Stefan: Elena, is that you?
Elena: I'm here.
Stefan: Where are you?
Elena: You lied.
Stefan: Not until I explain, please.
Elena: So, you didn't lie?
Stefan: Just tell me where you are, so that I can come get you.
Elena: How am I connected to Katherine, Stefan?
Stefan: I honestly don't know.
Elena: And I'm supposed to believe that?
Stefan: It's the truth. I-- Listen...
[Elena hangs up on him. She turns around; Damon is behind her.]

Damon: You okay?
Elena: Don't pretend to care. I know you're gloating inside.
[Inside, Bree calls somebody on the phone; she turns on a blender so she's not overheard.]

Bree: Hey, it's Bree. You'll never gonna guess who walked into my bar.
Fell's Church Ruins
[Bonnie wakes up just outside the tomb, and searches for a way out.]

Bonnie: Ow. Hello?! Anybody?! Ahh!
[She sees a pentagram inside a circle engraved on the wall.]

Gram's Residence
[Stefan walks up to the porch and knocks on the door, Grams answers.]

Stefan: Hi.
Grams: Can I help you?
Stefan: I'm Stefan. [Stefan extends his hand to Grams. She shakes it.] I'm a friend of Bonnie's. Her dad told me that she might be here.
Grams: She was. Not anymore.
Stefan: Do you know where she went?
Grams: No. But you do.
Stefan: I'm sorry?
Grams: I told her to face down her fear. And I'm sensing now that you know exactly why she was scared. You know what I am. And yet you offered me your hand, which means you wanted me to see that I can trust you.
Stefan: Can you?
Grams: I trust you'll keep her safe. You'd better be on your way, then. I'm not going to invite you in. I'm sure you understand why.
Mystic Falls Library
Anna: [gestures to an aisle of bookshelves] This aisle is local and state history. And Civil War is one over. What do you need?
Jeremy: Local. 1860s. Do you work here?
Anna: Nope. You want reference. This way. Um, home-schooled. I study here for a mock-school environment. Ah, here we go. Original settlers, town archives, Founders' stuff. It's all here. So, what's your topic?
Jeremy: The town's fear and hysteria surrounding the war and how it influenced certain writers of the time.
Anna: You might want to focus that.
Jeremy: The origin of local folklore and myths.
Anna: [smiling] You mean, the vampires?
Bree's Bar
[Elena and Damon are eating.]

Elena: Let's just say that I'm descended from Katherine...does that make me part vampire?
Damon: Vampires can't procreate. [eats a fry] But we love to try. [smirks] No, if you were related, it would mean Katherine had a child before she was turned.
Elena: Did Stefan think that he could use me to replace her?
Damon: Kinda creepy if you ask me. [beat] Come on, what? You don't like pickles? What's wrong with you?
Elena: How can you even eat? If technically you're supposed to be...
Damon: [whispers] Dead? [laughs] It's not such a bad word. As long as I keep a healthy diet of blood in my system, my body functions pretty normally.
Elena: [beat] This nice act. Is any of it real?
[Bree interrupts them.]

Bree: Here you go. [hands Damon a beer.]
Damon: Thank you.
Elena: I'll have one too.
Damon: [surprised] Hmm?
Elena: Time out, remember? For five minutes? Yeah, well that five minutes is going to need a beer.
Bree: [smiles] There you go. [Bree gives Elena a beer.]
Mystic Falls Library
Jeremy: You're kidding me, right? There's no such thing as vampires.
Anna: Well, there's not a lot of documentation, but the stories have been told since the Civil War. My granddad used to tell me all these creepy stories when I was little. And he said that his granddad told them to him.
Jeremy: Yeah, that would be folklore. Vampires are a metaphor for the demons of the day!
Anna: Which are?
Jeremy: The union soldiers! I've read the stories myself. They talk about the enemy, the demons that attack at night.
Anna: That sounds like vampires to me.
Jeremy: Allegorical vampires. Which is what it is. Creative expression during a very volatile time. I mean, a country at war doesn't want realism. They want fantasy. Thus, vampire fiction.
Anna: Man, you're smart. I gotta give it to you; when I first saw you, I missed it.
Jeremy: Yeah. I've had a rough go of it lately, but I'm just now getting back to my old self.
Anna: Well, good luck on your paper. I gotta get home. [beat] You know, my great grandfather actually showed me a journal once of an ancestor, and he had written all of this creepy stuff about vampires. It was actually really believable.
Jeremy: Wait. A journal?
Anna: Yeah? Why?
Jeremy: Are you sure you have to go?
Fell's Church Ruins
[Bonnie tries to receive a signal.]

Bonnie: Come on, phone! Great! Great.
[Bonnie slowly moves closer to the door with the pentagram. Stefan jumps down into the hole and taps Bonnie on the shoulder. She screams.]

Stefan: Bonnie!
Bonnie: [not knowing who it is] Get away from me!
Stefan: It's me! It's Stefan.
Bonnie: Stefan? [relaxes slightly and begins to explain] The ground gave way, and I fell...
Stefan: It's okay. It's okay. Calm down. Come on, let's get you out of here.
Bonnie: How?
Stefan: Just close your eyes. Trust me.
[Stefan wraps his arms around her firmly and jumps. When they land, he releases her.]

Stefan: You can open your eyes now.
Bonnie: [opens her tightly shut eyes and looks around] Whoa.
Stefan: I didn't want to scare you.
Bonnie: How did you know where I was?
Stefan: Well, your grandmother told me what you were doing. I guessed the where.
Bonnie: I heard them...down there...behind the door. [beat] Are they in pain?
Stefan: In the beginning...yes. But not anymore. They've starved to the point of desiccation.
Bonnie: But if they have blood...
Stefan: That's not going to happen, Bonnie. They can't get out. Emily saw to that when she had you destroy the crystal. You're safe.
Bree's Bar
[At the counter, Elena, Damon, Bree and others are taking shots of liquor.]

Bree: Ready....Go!
[They all shoot. Elena downs hers quickly, claps her hands, and does a little dance.]

Elena: That's three! [She looks at Damon and pretends to pout.] Aw, do you need a bib?
Damon: Sorry I can't unhinge my jaw like a snake to consume alcohol.
Elena: Whatever. All right. Who's next? Another round, Bree.
Woman: Honey, you should be on the floor!
Elena: [slightly drunkenly] I am not even drunk. My tolerance is, like, way up here. [Elena reaches for the sky.]
Bree: All right. Here you go. [Bree pours another round of shots.]
[A man enters the bar and goes to the counter away from Elena, Damon, and the other patrons. Bree goes over to him and motions with her head towards Elena and Damon.]

Mystic Grill
[Jeremy and Anna are playing pool.]

Jeremy: So, you have no idea where the journal is?
Anna: Nope. Gramps died. And all the kids split his stuff. I can ask.
Jeremy: I just find it weird that our ancestors kept the same kind of journal. It's crazy.
Anna: Maybe it's based in some partial reality.
Jeremy: No. It's gotta be metaphorical. My ancestor wrote short stories.
Anna: So, that's why you're hung up on the fiction of it all.
Jeremy: No, I'm hung up on the fiction of it all because I've seen The Lost Boys and Near Dark, like, fifty times.
Anna: Are those movies? Hey, I've never seen them. Maybe we can have a Fright Night and rent a whole bunch of vampire movies.
Jeremy: Uh, yeah, sure.
Anna: Why does that sound like a no way in hell? Sorry, I'm blunt.
Jeremy: No, it's--I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I just recently got out of something. It's a little too soon, you know?
Anna: Oh please, sure. No worries. I meant as friends. Yeah. Look, I really gotta go. Nice meeting you, Jeremy.
Bree's Bar
[Elena is playing pool. Her phone starts ringing, she stumbles over and picks it up.]

Elena: Hello?
Jenna: Elena?
Elena: Jenna! Hold on, it's loud in here.
Jenna: Elena, where are you? Are you okay?
Elena: Huh? Yeah. No, I'm good. Everything's fine. Hold on, I can't hear you.
Jenna: No, it's not fine! I got a call...
[Elena goes outside. She falls and drops her phone. She picks it back up.]

Elena: Hello ?
[The mysterious man from the bar comes up behind her and covers her mouth. She drops her phone.]

[Back inside the bar.]

Bree: Hey, where's your girl?
Damon: Hmm. She was right back there.
[Damon leaves the bar. He looks around and sees Elena's phone on the ground. He picks it up. He walks around the bar, over to an electrical building. Elena is hanging on to a tank.]

Elena: Damon, no!
[A man attacks him with a wooden plank with supernatural speed. It was a trap. The man hits him repeatedly. Elena jumps down from the tank and runs towards Damon.]

Damon: What the hell?!
[The man pours gasoline on Damon.]

Elena: No!
[The man turns to look at Elena, revealing vampire teeth.]

Damon: Who are you?
Lee: That's perfect! You have no idea.
Elena: What are you talking about? What did he do?
Lee: He killed my girlfriend. What did she do to you, huh? What did she do to you?!
Damon: Nothing.
Elena: I don't understand.
Lee: My girlfriend went to visit Stefan, and Damon killed her. Got it?
[He hits Damon with the bat.]

Damon: Ahhhhh.
Elena: Lexi? Lexi was your girlfriend? She told me about you. She said that you were human.
Lee: I was.
Elena: Lexi turned you?
Lee: If you want to be with someone forever, you have to live forever.
Elena: She loved you. She said that, When it's real, you can't walk away.
Lee: Well, that's a choice you're not going to have to make.
Elena: Don't. Don't, please, don't hurt him...
[The man lights a match.]

Lee: I'm doing you a favor.
Elena: Lexi loved you! And she was good! And that means you're good too. Be better than him. Don't do this. I'm begging you! Please.
[Lexi's boyfriend picks up Damon and throws him against the building, but stops attacking him after that.]

Elena: Thank you.
Lee: It wasn't for you.
[He leaves. Elena rushes to his side.]

Gram's Residence
Grams: Well, now, look who's returned from battle. Can I talk to your friend for a minute?
Bonnie: [to Stefan] Thank you.
[Bonnie goes inside; Grams stands in the doorway.]

Grams: I appreciate your help, Stefan.
Stefan: You're welcome, Sheila.
Grams: [smiles] I wasn't sure you remembered.
Stefan: October 1969.
Grams: I was barely a teenager!
Stefan: And you were leading what was probably the only anti-war sit-in within miles of Mystic Falls.
Grams: Hmm. [smiles.]
Stefan: You know, when you spoke, people were mesmerized. I know I was.
Grams: Until the cops showed up. [beat] You took a big risk coming to see me earlier. Letting me read you, realize who you were. It could have gone in a completely different way.
Stefan: Your family has a very long history of keeping my secret. I knew that I could trust you if you believed I was worthy of your trust.
Grams: Bonnie knows, doesn't she?
Stefan: Yes.
Grams: Please understand, our loyalty can only extend so far. This town won't be easy on any of us if they figure it out. And I'll protect my own before anybody else.
Stefan: I know that.
Grams: As long as we're clear. Goodnight, then.
Stefan: Goodnight, Sheila.
Bree's Bar
[At the bar. Bree is alone and taking a shot.]

Damon: [approaches Bree from behind] We were just leaving, I wanted to say good bye.
Bree: [doesn't turn around] [replies flatly] Good to see you again, Damon.
Damon: No kiss?
Bree: [turns around] I'm full of vervain. I put it in everything I drink.
Damon: And you're telling me this why?
Bree: Lexi was my friend. How could you? [She turns away but Damon is already in front of her, scaring her.] The tomb can be opened.
Damon: [moving closer to her] You're lying!
Bree: Emily's grimoire, her spellbook. If you know how she closed the tomb the reversal process will be in her book. You can open that tomb.
Damon: Where is this book?
Bree: I--I--
Damon: You have no idea.
Bree: No. I'm telling you the truth.
Damon: And I believe you. My dear, sweet Bree. That's why I'm almost sorry.
[Damon thrusts his hand into Bree's chest and grabs her heart.]

Bree: Ugh!
[Damon rips her heart out, wipes off his hand, grabs his jacket, and leaves.]

On The Road
[In Damon's car.]

Elena: So, why did you bring me with you?
Damon: Well, you're not the worst company in the world, Elena. You should give yourself more credit!
Elena: Seriously?
Damon: You were there in the road, all damsel-in-distress-like. And, I knew it would piss off Stefan. And...you're not the worst company in the world, Elena.
Elena: I used to be more fun.
Damon: You did okay.
Elena: I saved your life!
Damon: I know.
Elena: [smiles] And don't you forget it!
Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is in his room when Elena walks in to talk to him.]

Elena: Hi.
Stefan: Hi.
Elena: You could have told me.
Stefan: I wanted to tell you.
Elena: You said no more lies. Only the truth. I can handle the truth, Stefan. As crazy as it is, I can handle the fact that you are a vampire. And that you have a vampire brother. And that my best friend is a witch. I can accept the fact that the world is a much more mysterious place than I ever thought possible. But this...this lie, I cannot take. What am I to you? Who am I to you?
Stefan: You are not Katherine. You are the opposite of everything that she was.
Elena: And when did you figure that out? Before you kissed me? Before we slept together?
Stefan: Before I met you.
Elena: What?
Stefan: The first day of school. When we met. It wasn't for the first time, Elena.
Elena: Then when was it?
Stefan: May 23, 2009.
Elena: But that was...
Stefan: That was the day your parents' car went off the bridge.
Elena: You were there?
Stefan: Every couple of years I come back here, to see Zach and see my home. Last spring, I was out in the woods, by old Wickery Bridge. And I heard the accident. All of it. I was fast getting there, but not fast enough. The car was already submerged. Your dad was still...he was still conscious. I was able to get to him, but he wouldn't let me help him, until I helped you.
[Elena starts crying.]

Elena: Oh my god. When I woke up in the hospital, nobody could figure out how I got out of the car. They said it was a miracle.
Stefan: I went back for them. But it was too late. I couldn't-- I couldn't save them. When I pulled you out, I looked at your face. You looked like Katherine. I couldn't believe the resemblance. After that, I spent months making sure that you weren't her. I watched you. I learned everything that I could about you. And I saw that you were nothing like Katherine. And I wanted to leave town, but, Elena, I couldn't. I couldn't leave without knowing you. I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you. I wanted to. But you were so sad.
Elena: Why do I look like her?
Stefan: Elena, you've been through so much.
Elena: Why do I look like her, Stefan? What are you not telling me?
Stefan: It didn't make any sense to me. You were a Gilbert. She was a Pierce. But the resemblance was too similar. And then I learned the truth. [beat] You were adopted, Elena.
Mystic Falls Library
[Jeremy is sitting on the floor looking through books. Anna approaches him with a folder.]

Anna: There you are.
Jeremy: Hey.
Anna: Hi. Okay, look. I know I don't know you, so don't ask me why I did this. I just, sometimes...mostly all the time- I have this need to be right. So I googled and...
[She gives him the folder.]

Jeremy: What is it?
Anna: Proof. Sort of.
[Jeremy starts looking through it. It contains printed-out articles from the Mystic Falls Courier newspaper. Among the articles are ones titled Another Animal Attack - Second attack in Two Weeks leads to closings and cancelations, Campers Found Mauled - Animal Attack suspected in recent deaths.]

Jeremy: What does this mean?
Anna: Well, I only went as far back as 1942, and found that there's been a string of animal attacks periodically in and around this town for the past seventy-five years. It's consistent. In '62, five bodies found. In '53, four people killed. In '74, three people dead. And there's been five this year. All attacked. All suffered major blood loss, as in drained of blood.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan and Elena are sitting together on the sofa. Elena is still shaken up.]

Elena: How do you know all this?
Stefan: Your birth certificate from the city records. It says Elena Gilbert, Mystic Falls General. But there's no record of your mother ever being admitted. There's no record of her ever being pregnant.
Elena: What else do you know?
Stefan: For me to go any further, I would've had to look into the Pierce family, and I couldn't do that. It's too much of a risk. If someone found out I was asking about Katherine...Listen to me, it doesn't matter. You are the woman that I love. I love you.
[Elena kisses him. Stefan cradles her in his arms as she cries.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jenna is agitatedly flipping the pages of a magazine on the sofa when Elena walks in. Jenna turns around.]

Jenna: I don't set a lot of rules, Elena. Not with you. I trust you to tell me the truth. Where were you? Why would you lie to me about it? I thought that we were closer than that.
Elena: Now is not the time you want to talk to me about lies.
Jenna: Don't do that. Don't turn this back on me. I didn't do anything.
[Jenna gets up and follows her to the staircase.]

Elena: Okay...Question: am I adopted? I trust you to tell me the truth too, Jenna. How could you not tell me? I thought we were closer than that.
Jenna: Elena, I didn't...they asked me not to.
Elena: I don't want to hear it! [Elena walks up the stairs and into her room.]
Mystic Grill
[Alaric is sitting at the bar, drinking, when Damon walks and sits at the counter. Alaric turns in his direction and the two make brief eye contact.]

Damon: Bourbon.
[Flashback: Isobel is in bed, and Alaric is getting ready to leave.]

Isobel: I love you.
Alaric: I'm going to be late tonight.
[Later: Alaric returns and goes to the bedroom. He sees Damon holding Isobel in his arms, drinking her blood.]

[Alaric recognizes Damon as the vampire who killed Isobel. He sets his drink on the bar, his hand visibly trembling.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena and Stefan are lying on Elena's bed together, conversing about the previous days events.]

Elena: Stefan, who was that man in the road?
Stefan: I don't know. Do you remember anything else about him?
Elena: I wish. I never really saw his face. He was wearing a hoodie. All I can remember is that there was these black boots coming towards me.
Stefan: I brought some vervain for, um, for you and Jenna. [Grabs a box from the end of the bed. Elena sits up straight. Stefan opens the box up.] And, um, I made this bracelet for Jeremy, few extra ones for friends. [Stefan hands Elena the bracelet. She takes it and observes it.] You can put it in jewelry, or you can even put it in food or drink, but as long as it's in you or on you, a vampire cannot control you. [Stefan hands Elena a small vial of liquid vervain.]
Elena: [picks up a dried up branch of vervain from the box] Wow. So much to remember.
Stefan: I know, but there's another vampire in town. So until we find out who it is and what he wants, we have to be careful.
[Elena nods understandingly.]

[Downstairs, Jeremy is sketching at the dining room table. The doorbell rings and Jeremy gets up to answer it. A pizza delivery guy waits on the front porch.]

Noah: Hey. It's gonna be $22. [pulls pizza out of the bag.]
Jeremy: [yelling up the stairs] Elena, I need the money! Uh, here. Come in. Just put it on the table.
[Jeremy walks back into the dining room. The young man stands on the front porch for a moment longer before crossing the threshold into the house. He places the pizza on the table while Elena comes down the stairs, retrieving the money from her wallet.]

Elena: Hi. Um, keep the change.
[Elena hands the money to Noah who takes it. Noah starts to walk backwards, out of the house.]

Noah: Thanks. And you have yourself a good night.
[Elena smiles and shuts the door. Noah turns around, pulls the hood of his sweater over his head, and walks down the steps of the front porch. It is clear that he is the vampire that caused Elena's car accident and now he has been invited in her house.]

[TITLE CARD AND OPENING CREDITS]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan walks into the library, books are strewn haphazardly across the room. When he enters, he sees Damon, looking through the shelves and tossing aside books. Stefan stops and looks at him.]

Stefan: What are you lookin' for, Damon?
Damon: Not your concern.
Stefan: No, but putting Elena in harm's way, that is my concern.
Damon: [flipping through a book, not looking up at Stefan] Hm hm. What are you talking about?
Stefan: I'm talking about Atlanta.
Damon: [looks away from his back and at Stefan] Oh, yeah. Elena and I had blast.
Stefan: I get it. You're just bitter because one of us gets to be with the person that we love, and poor Katherine is just out of reach. Unless there's another way for you to get into that tomb. Is that what Bree said?
Damon: You're pathetic when you're fishing.
Stefan: And you're transparent when you're deflecting.
Damon: Don't you have school?
[Damon grabs another book off the shelf. Stefan walks out of the room and Damon looks up and watches him leave.]

Mystic Falls High School
[The bell rings signaling the end of class. Students get up from their desks and start to leave the classroom. Jeremy is packing up his stuff when a paper is thrown down onto his desk by Alaric. Jeremy looks down at the paper and picks it up. A giant red A is marked on the paper. Jeremy smiles, stunned by his grade.]

Alaric: Surprised? It's a good essay. Your thoughts are clear, and your argument is well laid out. It's just, uh, you don't actually think there are vampires in Mystic Falls.
[Alaric sits down behind his desk.]

Jeremy: No. I mean, I think statistically there's been more animal attacks, mysterious deaths, uh, people gone missing, more than any other place in the whole commonwealth of Virginia.
Alaric: It's conjecture, but creative, which is why you got the A. I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up in the whole conspiracy theory of it all.
Jeremy: Ah, I won't.
[Jeremy gathers up his stuff, gets up, and starts to exit the room.]

Alaric: Oh, uh, Jeremy,the source that you cited for the 1860s info, uh, Johnathan Gilbert...?
[Jeremy stops and looks back at Alaric.]

Jeremy: Oh, my ancestor's journal?
Alaric: I'd really like to see that sometime.
Jeremy: Really?
Alaric: A first-person account of the Civil War? That's like, uh, porn for a history teacher.
[Jeremy retrieves the journal from his backpack.]

Jeremy: You think my essay's creative, wait till you get a load of this thing.
[Jeremy tosses the journal onto Alaric's desk. Alaric picks it up carefully.]

Alaric: Thank you.
[Jeremy nods and exits the room. Alaric looks at the journal and unbinds it with curiosity.]

[Out in the front courtyard, Elena and Caroline are walking across the lawn together. Caroline is observing the necklace around her neck which Elena just gave her.]

Caroline: It's so pretty. Thank you. God, it'll go with, like, everything. What's the occasion?
Elena: No occasion. Just a little friend gift.
[Elena and Caroline sit down at a table.]

Caroline: Lesbian friend necklace? Cause we're freaky like that?
[Caroline winks at Elena, sarcastically.]

Elena: Your friendship is important to me.
Caroline: Why are you being so mushy?
Elena: Because you've been avoiding me, and I wanted you to know that whatever is going on with you and Matt, it's ok.
Caroline: I was gonna talk to you about that. I was, but there's just not much to say. You know, we've hung out a couple times. That's it, but...I just feel like we've peeked as friends. [Elena nods.] This is weird. I shouldn't be talking to you about this. It's weird. It's weird, right?
Elena: It's a little weird, but [laughs] if it's what you and Matt want, then it's not about me.
Caroline: But it's all about you. Matt's not over you, and we all know it.
Elena: I'm with Stefan now. Matt understands that. He knows he has to move on.
[Elena unwraps her sandwich and Caroline looks at her, unconvinced.]

Mystic Grill
[Matt is sitting at the bar, filling out a job application. Ben walks over to him from the other side of the bar and places a tray of glasses down.]

Ben McKittrick: Matt Donovan. What do you know?
Matt: Ben McKittrick. What's up, man?
Ben McKittrick: Rough season, bud.
Matt: Yeah. It's kind of hard to recover when you have to forfeit half your games.
Ben McKittrick: You gonna be workin' here?
Matt: Yep, followin' in your footsteps, minus the state championship.
Ben McKittrick: Well, we can't all be Football Gods.
Matt: Yeah.
Ben McKittrick: So what's the plan? Cook line?
Matt: Busboy.
[Down in the restaurant, Elena and Bonnie are having dinner at a table.]

Bonnie: I can't believe you're adopted. I never saw that coming.
Elena: And it gets weirder. I looked at my birth certificate. It lists Miranda and Grayson Gilbert as my birthparents. None of it makes any sense.
Bonnie: Which is why you should ask Jenna.
[Elena groans.]

Bonnie: First of all, the Elena I know would always want the real truth, good or bad.
Elena: And second of all?
Bonnie: You just found out your boyfriend is a [whispers] vampire, so unless your birthparents are aliens...[Elena laughs.] How bad could it be?
Elena: Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store. My outfit for the dance is severely lacking accessories.
[Elena gets up.]

Bonnie: Ok, I'll pay the bill.
Elena: Ok. Bye.
[Elena leaves. Bonnie gets up to pay.]

Bonnie: Bye.
[Bonnie starts to walk away from the table when Damon approaches her. She stops and looks at him.]

Bonnie: What do you want from me?
Damon: I think we need a fresh start.
Bonnie: You tried to kill me.
Damon: But I didn't, and if I wanted to, I would have. Does that not count for anything?
Bonnie: You know, I can start fires with my mind. Fires kill vampires, right? [Damon looks slightly concerned.] Just stay the hell away from me.
[Ben walks over to Bonnie and Damon.]

Ben McKittrick: Everything ok over here?
Damon: Yeah, we're fine.
Ben McKittrick: I wasn't talkin' to you.
[Damon, controlling his urge to kill Ben, grimaces, and walks away. Ben moves to stand in front of Bonnie.]

Bonnie: Thank you.
Ben McKittrick: Anytime, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Wait. You remember me?
Ben McKittrick: I didn't graduate that long ago. You're makin' me feel old.
Bonnie: No, sorry. I didn't...I didn't mean that. I just, I didn't know you knew me.
Ben McKittrick: I always know a pretty face.
[Bonnie smiles.]

[Outside of the Grill, Elena is walking through the parking lot. Her cell phone starts ringing and she retrieves it from her purse.]

Elena: [answers phone, holds up to ear, continues walking to car] Hello.
Noah: Hello, Elena.
Elena: Hey, who's this?
[Elena halts when she reaches her cars and retrieves her keys.]

Noah: You hit me with your car.
[Elena freezes.]

Noah: Is that a new one?
[Elena, mouth hanging open, looks behind her. She sees the man in the hoodie approaching her.]

Noah: You got away from me. You won't next time
[Elena quickly unlocks the car door, gets in, ignites the engine, reverses, and speeds off down the road, right past Noah, who watches her drive off as he walks across the road.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena is sitting on a couch in the library, speaking with Stefan.]

Elena: Why me? What does he want with me? A-and if he's trying to kill me, then why call first?
[Stefan walks around the couch and faces Elena.]

Stefan: That's because we're predators, Elena. We hunt. We stalk. It's often as exciting as the kill. I want you to take this.
[Stefan sits down on the table in front of Elena and pulls out the vampire compass. Stefan hands the compass to Elena. Elena takes it and looks at it.]

Elena: This is Jeremy's pocket watch. How did you get it?
Stefan: I took it from Damon, who took it from Logan, who must have taken it from you.
[Elena opens it up and observes the contents, confused.]

Elena: What happened to it?
Stefan: Well, it's not just a watch. It's a...it's a sort of compass, but it points to vampires.
[Stefan gently takes Elena's hands in his own, showing her how the compass works. The needle whirs around on the compass and finally clicks into place, pointing at Stefan. Elena looks up at him in shock.]

Elena: Why did my father have it?
Stefan: Gilberts were one of the founding families, and back in 1864, they were among those who sought to eradicate the vampires. The compass was used to find us.
Elena: Did you know them?
Stefan: Yes. I want you to keep this. That way, you'll know if you're ever in danger.
[Elena nods. Stefan caresses her cheek. Elena smiles and pulls Stefan in for a kiss. After they pull apart, Elena smiles at Stefan again, as they sit together in the library.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Matt and Caroline are outside in the schoolyard, painting a banner for the dance.]

Matt: I've never seen you such a mess.
Caroline: [scoffs, smiling up at Matt] Don't talk smack.
[Caroline swipes the paintbrush on Matt's arm, leaving a giant smear of paint on him.]

Matt: I mean, [Matt threateningly holds his paintbrush out at Caroline, who backs away, smiling.] I just thought that you told everyone else what to do.
[Matt and Caroline go back to painting the banner.]

Caroline: Well, I do that, too, but if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. You know, I just like that we're hanging out. Who knew, you and me?
Matt: Well, who knew you could be fun?
[They smile at each other and continue to paint.]

Caroline: So what are you wearing to this dumb dance, anyway? Should we color-coordinate?
Matt: Uh, I'm not goin'.
Caroline: Why not?
Matt: I gotta work, bussin' tables at the Grill.
Caroline: Since when are you a busboy?
Matt: It's a job. You know, some of us have to work, Caroline. With our mom in and out, things are tight, so...
Caroline: [looks up at Matt] Well, I didn't mean it like that. I just meant that I didn't know you had a job.
Matt: Well, I do. I gotta go.
[Matt puts down the paintbrush and leaves. Caroline watches him walk away with a sad face.]

Mystic Grill
[Jeremy is shooting pool when Anna approaches him.]

Anna: Hey. How'd it go?
Jeremy: What?
Anna: The paper.
Jeremy: Oh. I got an A. Thanks for the articles. They really helped.
Anna: Cool. So what'd he say about the vampires? Did he believe it?
Jeremy: I don't even believe it. It's just a paper, Anna. Anyways, I, uh, I gotta get goin'.
[Jeremy gets up and walks around the pool table. Anna follows him.]

Anna: Uh, hey, um...D-do you wanna do something later, maybe?
Jeremy: Uh, sorry. I'm stuck on punch duty at the school dance.
Anna: Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?
Jeremy: Well, I'm failin' English, so I copped a plea.
Anna: Maybe, you know, tomorrow or something.
[Jeremy smiles and looks down. Anna catches on.]

Anna: I'm being pushy again, aren't I? Heh.
Jeremy: Well, thanks for the help. I'll, I'll see you around.
[Jeremy grabs his backpack and leaves. Anna watches him go, looking displeased with herself.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jenna, dressed up in a cute '50s outfit, is cleaning up the living room. Elena walks in the room.]

Jenna: Spoke to the insurance company. Car's totaled. You can keep using mine for now.
Elena: So you're coming to the dance?
Jenna: [smiling] Alaric asked me to help chaperone.
[Jenna walks around the couch and leans against it. Elena, not looking at her, picks up an apple and is about to take a bite, but turns around and looks accusingly at Jenna.]

Elena: Why didn't you tell me, Jenna?
[Jenna looks slightly startled by this sudden change of topic.]

Jenna: Your mom was gonna do it eventually. I never thought I'd have to.
Elena: If my mom were here right now and I asked, she'd tell me the truth.
Jenna: Your dad was about to leave the office one night when this girl showed up. She was sixteen, a runaway, and about to give birth. He delivered her baby, and he gave her a place to stay, but a few days later, she disappeared. And there you were. Your parents were trying so hard to have a baby. I-it just wasn't happening. All Miranda ever wanted was to be a mom.
Elena: Well, why were my parents' names on the birth certificate?
Jenna: Your dad was a doctor, Elena. He took care of it. They didn't wanna lose you, so they kept it quiet, told as few people as possible, but if anyone ever wanted proof, they had documentation.
Elena: What else do you know about her? The girl?
Jenna: Just her name. Isobel.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is sitting at a desk in the library, jotting down names of the Founders of Mystic Falls. Stefan walks into the library, holding something behind his back. He approaches Damon.]

Damon: [commenting on Stefan's '50s styled hair] You got the hair right. [Stefan drops a journal down on the desk in front of Damon.] Why are you bringing me dad's journal?
Stefan: Cause you were looking for it.
Damon: And why would I want it?
Stefan: Gee, I don't know, Damon. Maybe you wanna do a little bit of posthumous bonding. Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it. I have. Nowhere in it does it say anything about Katherine, or the tomb, or how to open it.
[Damon retrieves the journal from the end of the desk and flips through the pages.]

Damon: I'm not surprised. Man could barely spell his own name.
Stefan: I'm really sorry that it won't be of any help with your diabolical plan, the sequel. [Damon smirks.] You know, I could help you.
Damon: You? Help me? Aw, I don't know. Seems a little unnatural.
Stefan: I'll do anything to get you out of this town, even release Katherine.
Damon: What about the other 26 vampires?
Stefan: No, no, no. They can't come. They have to stay put, but Katherine, I would consider that.
Damon: What are you doin'? Hmm? What's your angle?
Stefan: Think about it.
Damon: Why would I trust you?
Stefan: See that's your problem, Damon. You apply all of your shortcomings to everybody else. If history's any indication, there's only one liar among us.
[Stefan grimaces at Damon, pats the journal, and leaves the room.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is in her bedroom, adding the finishing touches to her '50s hairstyle. She walks into the bathroom and blow dries her hair as she pulls a round brush through it. In her bedroom, Elena has left the vampire compass on her bed. Suddenly, the needle starts to whirl around, but Elena cannot hear it over the noise of the blow dryer. Elena, satisfied with her hair, turns the dryer off and walks out of the bathroom. The needle of the compass is pointing at her closet which Elena is heading towards. She opens the closet, dramatically the compass starts whirring again, and no one is hiding in the closet. Elena retrieves a pink scarf from a hanger. Elena shuts the closet door and walks over to her doorway, poking her head into the hall.]

Elena: Hey, Jenna. Jenna? Jeremy?
[No one responds to Elena. The compass' needle continues to spin around and Elena, hearing the noise, turns her head towards the compass. She finally sees the needle spinning out of control. Elena walks over to the bed, quickly, and picks up the compass, looking at the needle. She picks up her phone and dials Stefan's number before quickly walking out of the room.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon, still sitting at the desk, hears Stefan's phone go off. He walks over to it and picks it up, seeing that it's Elena.]

Damon: Stefan's phone. How may I help you?
Gilbert Residence
[Elena quickly walks down the stairs and anxiously speaks to Damon.]

Elena: Where is he?
Damon: He's on his way to you. Forgot his phone.
[Elena stops in the living room.]

Elena: [sighs] Oh, thank God. This compass was spinning. [Right above Elena, Noah is braced to the ceiling looking down at Elena.] Stefan must be here. Thank you.
Damon: You're welcome.
[Elena hangs up. Suddenly, Noah jumps down from the ceiling. Elena spins around and gasps. Noah grabs Elena and extends his fangs, getting ready to bite her neck. Elena screams. Before Noah can bite her, Stefan yells from the kitchen and rushes in.]

Stefan: Elena!
[Stefan pulls Noah off of Elena and throws him over the couch. Elena loses her balance and falls to the floor. Stefan looks down at her, worried. Noah grunts and gets up from the floor and vamp-speeds out of the house. When Stefan is certain that Noah won't be returning, Stefan dashes over to Elena. Elena pushes herself off the floor and Stefan embraces her. Elena, still frightened, tightly holds on to Stefan.]

Stefan: Are you ok? Are you ok?
[Elena looks at the front door, still worried that her attacker will return.]

[Stefan and Elena have been joined at the house by Damon. Damon paces around the living room while Stefan and Elena sit on the couch next to each other.]

Damon: How did he get in?
Elena: He was invited in.
Stefan: He posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.
Damon: Well, he gets points for that. Did he say what he wanted?
Elena: No. He was too busy trying to kill me.
Stefan: And you have no idea who this is?
Damon: No. [Stefan looks unconvinced] Don't look at me like that. I told you we had company.
Elena: You think there's more than one?
Damon: We don't know.
[Damon sits on the arm of the couch.]

Stefan: Damon, he was invited in.
[Damon nods, understanding what Stefan is hinting at.]

Damon: Then we go get him tonight. [to Elena] You up for it?
Elena: What do I have to do?
Damon: Let your boyfriend take you to the dance. We'll see who shows up.
Stefan: That's a bad idea.
Damon: Till we get him, this house isn't safe. For anyone who lives in it. It's worth a shot.
Elena: I'll do it.
[Stefan looks anxious. Damon nods, agreeing. Elena grabs Stefan's hand in her own and looks at him.]

Elena: I'll be with the two of you. I'll be safe.
[Stefan nods and looks up at Damon, who shrugs his shoulder.]

Mystic Falls High School
[The '50s dance. The students of Mystic Falls are dressed in their best '50s getups and dancing to This Magic Moment. Caroline and Bonnie are dancing together on the dance floor. Elena and Stefan, arms linked, walk into the dance, with Damon standing on the other side of Elena. They look around the dance floor for any sign of danger. Alaric spots Damon from the other side of the room and the smile falls from his face as he recognizes who Damon is. Suddenly, Jenna approaches Alaric.]

Jenna: Alaric.
Alaric: Hey, look at you.
Jenna: I figured I'd stand out less if I dressed up.
Alaric: Heh heh. Liar.
Jenna: Ok, I'm a sucker for the decade dance. I went to school here, you know. They do the sixties and seventies, too, FYI.
Alaric: Oh. Can't wait. Can I get you a drink? I hear the punch is real boss.
[Alaric smiles and the two of them share a laugh. Alaric and Jenna walk off together.]

[Elena is standing by the punch bowl, nervously fidgeting with her earring. Caroline and Bonnie approach her.]

Elena: Having fun?
Caroline: No, but this took about two hours, so I'm at least staying half of that.
[Caroline and Elena laugh. Bonnie looks off into the distance.]

Bonnie: What's Damon doing here?
[Elena and Caroline turn to look at Damon, who is standing with Stefan. Elena turns back around.]

Elena: He wanted to come. I promise. He'll behave.
Caroline: So what is this, like, a threesome now, you and the Salvatore brothers?
Elena: No, but if I'm gonna be with Stefan, then I have to learn to tolerate Damon. It's not like I can kill him.
Bonnie: [still staring at Damon] There's a thought.
Caroline: Mmm. I'll help.
[Caroline and Bonnie clink their glasses together. Elena looks down, trying hard not to smile at her friends' comments.]

[Alaric and Jenna walk across the dancefloor, punch cups in hand.]

Jenna: I'm really starting to see a change in Jeremy. Finally.
Alaric: Uh, losing someone you love so suddenly, the, uh, the trauma and the grief there are some of the tougher things he'll face in life.
[They stop in front of the projection screen and face each other.]

Jenna: From someone who knows. You have no idea what happened?
Alaric: That's the hard part, not knowing.
Jenna: Is it ok to talk about your wife?
Alaric: Heh. There's not much to talk about.
Jenna: That must be impossible to deal with, not having any answers.
Alaric: I'd be lying to you if I told you it didn't keep me up at night. Wondering why, by who.
Jenna: Maybe one day.
Alaric: Hope so.
[Alaric looks off into the distance.]

Alaric: I hope so.
[Alaric is shown to be looking at Damon, who is standing across the room, his arms folded over his chest.]

[Bonnie and Caroline are still mingling around the punch bowl. Damon approaches them.]

Damon: Hi, Bonnie. Wanna dance?
Bonnie: I'm out of here.
[Bonnie and Caroline look at him with disgust. Bonnie starts to walk away but Damon blocks her with his body.]

Damon: Please give me another chance.
[Bonnie doesn't respond and moves around Damon, walking away from him. Caroline glares at Damon.]

Caroline: Back off, Damon.
[Caroline follows Bonnie. Damon watches them leave. Stefan and Elena approach Damon.]

Elena: Where did they go?
Damon: I don't know.
Stefan: What did you say to them?
Damon: I was perfectly polite. Elena...Would you like to dance?
Elena: I would love to.
[Elena looks up at Stefan.]

Elena: May I have this dance?
[Stefan lends her his arm and she takes it. Elena looks up Damon with a devilish smile. Damon rolls his eyes. Elena and Stefan go onto the dance floor. Stefan twirls Elena around and pulls her into him. Elena wraps her arms around his neck, smiling brightly, as they sway to the music. Across the room, Noah, the boy with the hoodie, watches Elena.]

[Elena and Stefan are still on the dancefloor. Elena still has her arms wrapped around Stefan's neck and Stefan has his hands placed on her hips. While they dance, Stefan looks around for any signs of the vampire.]

Elena: Shouldn't you guys be able to sense each other or something?
Stefan: No. Doesn't work that way. See him anywhere?
Elena: Not unless he has a pompadour.
Stefan: Heh. Wow. Not one of the better fashion trends.
Elena: Come on. I'm sure you looked great back then. Are there pictures?
Stefan: No. Burned. Buried.
Elena: Seriously, what was it like, the fifties? Cause in my mind, I have this picture of somewhere between American Bandstand, Grease. It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.
Stefan: Well, that and, you know, McCarthyism and segregation and nuclear arms race.
Elena: Ok, but there were poodle skirts?
Stefan: There were poodle skirts.
[Stefan spins Elena around and pulls her back in.]

Elena: [smiling] You're so teaching me how to do the hand jive.
Stefan: No. That's not gonna happen.
Elena: Ooh!
[Elena rests her head on Stefan's shoulder as Stefan continues to watch out for the vampire.]

[Across the room, Jeremy is manning the punch bowl. Anna comes out of nowhere and walks up to him.]

Anna: You neglected to mention this was a theme party.
Jeremy: What are you doing here?
Anna: Well, seeing as you also neglected to invite me, I took matters into my own hands.
Jeremy: You're doin' that thing again.
Anna: What thing would that be?
Jeremy: That thing where you pretend we're dating, even though we're not.
Anna: [sarcastically] Oh, you mean stalking. Yeah. [laughs] Get over yourself. Come on. I've never been to a school dance before. Humor me.
[Jeremy smiles at Anna.]

Mystic Grill
[Matt is bussing tables at the Grill. He looks up as Caroline and Bonnie enter, still in their '50s garb. Bonnie looks earnestly up at the bar.]

Bonnie: Let's sit up there.
[Caroline stops and crosses her arms, teasing Bonnie.]

Caroline: Be a little more obvious, Bonnie.
Bonnie: Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.
[Without them noticing, Matt has come up behind them, carrying dirty dishes in a bin.]

Caroline: What? It's just a drizzle. Ben McKittrick? Really?
Bonnie: He's hot.
Caroline: He's a washed-up jock who pours drinks for a living. You could do way better.
[Matt, having paused to hear the conversation, looks down and walks past Caroline, who finally notices him.]

Caroline: Hey.
Matt: [without looking at her, tonelessly] What's up?
[Caroline's smile falters at his lack of enthusiasm of seeing her.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Stefan and Elena, both smiling broadly, continue to dance to a fast paced song. Damon watches them from off the dancefloor. Alaric approaches Damon.]

Alaric: Yeah, I don't recognize you. How'd you get roped into chaperoning? Alaric Saltzman. I'm the new history teacher.
[Alaric and Damon shake hands.]

Damon: Ah, the, uh, cursed faculty position.
Alaric: So I've been told.
Damon: Damon. Salvatore.
Alaric: Salvatore, as in, uh, Stefan?
Damon: He's my little brother. I'm his legal guardian, hence the chaperoning.
Alaric: I hear he's very bright, not that I've had a chance to see for myself.
Damon: Well, his attendance record's a little spotty. Family drama.
Alaric: No parents?
Damon: Mm, it's just the two of us now.
Alaric: You, uh, you live here your whole life?
Damon: On and off. Travel a bit.
Alaric: Really? Where? Around the states? [Damon looks at him with raised eyebrows] Heh. I'm sorry. I'm nosy. I...I don't mean to pry. Look, it was nice meeting you.
Damon: You, too.
Alaric: Enjoy the rest of the dance.
[Alaric pats Damon on the arm and walks past him. Damon watches him leave.]

Mystic Grill
[Caroline and Bonnie are sitting at a table. Bonnie stares at Ben behind the bar and Caroline sulks.]

Caroline: Tonight was so much better on paper.
Bonnie: Ah, you're just feeling sorry for yourself. Go and talk to him. Be bold and fearless.
Caroline: Yeah, this coming from the girl who's been eye stalking the bartender.
Bonnie: You're right.
[Bonnie boldly gets up and walks over to the bar. Caroline watches her, looking impressed. Bonnie stops in front of the bar and speaks to Ben.]

Bonnie: Hi.
Ben McKittrick: Twice in one day. Lucky me.
Bonnie: I'm proving something to my friend.
Ben McKittrick: Oh, yeah? What's that?
Bonnie: That you don't have to sit around and wait for a guy to come up to you.
Ben McKittrick: Does that mean that you're asking me out on a date?
Bonnie: Does that mean you want me to?
Ben McKittrick: Well, what did you have in mind?
Bonnie: [hesitates] Do you like karaoke?
Ben McKittrick: No. [Bonnie looks hopeless.] But I would really like to go on a date with you.
[Ben leans closer towards Bonnie and smiles. Bonnie smiles back, flirtatiously. Back at their table, Caroline watches with disdain. Matt walks past her table, but completely ignores Caroline.]

Caroline: Seriously?
[Matt stops and looks at her.]

Matt: Is that for me?
Caroline: Do you see anyone else in the vicinity?
Matt: Do you need something?
Caroline: Are you mad at me or something?
Matt: No, Care. I'm not mad. I...
Caroline: Well, then why are you being so weird?
Matt: I'm not. I'm working.
Caroline: You're avoiding.
Matt: No. I have a table to clean. You know, that's the kind of thing that washed-up jocks do to make a living.
[Matt walks away. Caroline, realizing that he heard what she said earlier, sighs.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Anna carries three stacks of paper cups over to Jeremy who takes them from her.]

Jeremy: You don't go to school here. You know, you don't have to help.
Anna: Oh, I don't mind. It's fun. Oh, um, yeah. Before I forget, can I borrow your ancestor's journal?
Jeremy: Why?
Anna: You said I could read it.
Jeremy: Uh, I don't have it.
Anna: Oh. Well, obviously you didn't bring it here, uh, but I can walk you home.
Jeremy: No. I mean, I gave it to my history teacher.
Anna: Wait. Why did you give it to him?
Jeremy: Because he wanted to read it.
Anna: You know, you shouldn't be giving that to just anybody.
Jeremy: But I should give it to you?
Anna: Loan. Loan it to me.
Jeremy: Well, I loaned it to Mr. Saltzman.
Anna: Maybe he's in his classroom. We can get it back.
Jeremy: What's the big deal with this stupid journal?
[Jeremy leans across the table towards Anna. Suddenly, Anna's eyes begin to change.]

Jeremy: [confused] Your eye.
[Anna blinks and turns around.]

Anna: Um, there's something in it. Forget it. I...I gotta go.
[Anna leaves.]

[Elena and Stefan are swaying on the dancefloor and looking around for the vampire.]

Elena: Maybe he's not gonna show.
Stefan: You mean we did all this dancing for nothing?
[Elena throws her head back and moves her hands down to Stefan's chest.]

Elena: Ahh. The horror.
[They both smile.]

Stefan: I'm really sorry for all this.
Elena: It's my choice. I decided to be here. I officially signed up for it, so I don't wanna hear you apologizing anymore.
[Elena makes her point by poking Stefan in the chest as she says the last few words. Suddenly, the music starts to pick up. Stefan looks up at the speakers, realizing he will have to dance faster. Elena smiles broadly, grabs Stefan's hands and starts to twist her hips, but Stefan remains still.]

Elena: Show me how it's done in the fifties.
Stefan: Uh, no.
Elena: Come on. One move?
[Stefan shakes his head. Elena nods persistently. Stefan shakes his head again. Elena groans and starts to walk off the dancefloor, but Stefan grabs her by the arm and twirls her back towards him. He picks Elena up and dips her on one side and then the other, holding her in the dip for a moment. Elena smiles up at him, surprised. Stefan straightens them back up and places Elena on the floor, grabs her face in his hands, and kisses her with intense passion.]

Stefan: Now you remember that, because it's never gonna happen again.
[Elena giggles and they kiss again.]

[Anna is walking down the darkened corridors of the school. She stops at the end of one and sees Noah at the other end. Anna vamp speeds over to him. He looks down at her with a devilish smile.]

Noah: What are you doing here?
Anna: Trying to get the journal, as in sticking to the plan, something you're not doing. [sighs] Leave the girl alone.
Noah: I like her. She looks like Katherine.
Anna: She's not Katherine. Ok, Katherine is in the tomb.
Noah: I know, but until we open that tomb, I got her to play with.
Anna: Don't be stupid. That girl is with the Salvatore brothers.
Noah: They don't scare me. They never have.
Anna: Please, Noah. Don't do this. You're gonna ruin everything.
Noah: You got nothing to worry about. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. You will get what you came for. Just let me have my fun. [says as if it's an acceptable excuse] She looks like Katherine.
[Noah walks past Anna, placing his hood over his head.]

[Back out on the dancefloor, Damon has found a girl to dance with. He gropes her bottom and they glide across the dancefloor. Elena watches from the punch bowl with Stefan. She laughs and looks up at Stefan.]

Elena: You really can't take him anywhere, can you?
Stefan: Uh, no.
[Elena looks across the floor and sees Noah in his hoodie. She turns back to Stefan.]

Elena: Stefan, the back corner.
[Stefan looks in the corner.]

Stefan: Get Damon.
[Stefan quickly walks across the dancefloor, pushing students out of his way. The boy in the hoodie has exited the dance and walks down a crowded corridor into another darker corridor. Stefan enters the corridor and sees the boy turn the corner. Stefan jogs after him, then when they are in the darkened corridor, he vamp speeds over to the boy, grabs him by his hoodie and slams him into the lockers.]

Boy: [without expression] What did I do?
[Stefan looks at the boy, confused.]

Stefan: Where is he?
Boy: I was getting a soda, and then this guy gave me his hoodie.
[Stefan looks around, realizing he's been tricked into leaving Elena alone.]

[Elena walks across the dancefloor, searching for Damon. Her cell phone rings. She takes it out of her pocket and answers it.]

Noah: Hello, Elena. [Elena pauses on the floor, terrified.] Here's what you're going to do. [Elena looks around her for the source of the call.]There's an exit door behind you. You have five seconds.
Elena: No.
Noah: Or your brother dies.
[Elena looks over at the punch bowl where Jeremy is serving punch. Elena sees Noah standing near him, on his phone with Elena.]

Noah: I can snap his neck so fast I bet there's not even a witness. Now, start walking.
Elena: [starts backing up towards the door] Don't you dare touch him.
Noah: Keep walking. Through the door.
[Elena keeps walking backwards across the floor. Noah starts walking past Jeremy. Elena, worried, continues to watch him, but Noah passes Jeremy without even touching him. Elena hangs up her phone and runs out the exit. Elena runs down the corridor, looking behind her to see if Noah is following. She turns into another corridor and comes to a set of doors. She attempts to open the doors but they are chained shut. She turns back around and sees Noah walking calmly towards her. Elena rushes down a different corridor and opens the door to the cafeteria. She runs across the room and tries to open another set of doors which are also locked. Across the room, Noah flings open a set of double doors and before Elena can move, he vamp-speeds towards her. Elena attempts to bolt but Noah grabs her by her hair and Elena screams and struggles to get away. Noah pulls her in towards him then throws her across a table. Elena lands hard on the floor. Noah tosses the table aside and strides towards Elena. Elena frantically grabs at a pencil on the floor and sits up. Noah grabs Elena from off the floor and pushes her against the wall. He extends his fangs and prepares to bite her, but Elena stabs him in the stomach with the pencil. Noah, unprepared for this, takes the pencil out of his stomach and starts towards Elena again. Elena prepares to attack again and Noah raises his hand to defend himself, but Elena's pencil weapon goes straight through the palm of his hand. Noah looks down at his hand and while he's distracted, Elena stabs him with another pencil and pushes Noah to the floor. As Noah struggles to get up, Elena walks backwards and bumps into a mop bucket. She turns around and grabs the mop from the bucket and uses her knee to break the handle in two to create a stake. Noah rips the pencil out of his hand and gets up. As he advances towards Elena, she thrusts the stake towards him, but he is too quick and grabs her wrist. Noah takes the stake out of her hand and tosses it aside. He then goes in to bite her neck. Elena screams, but before Noah can bite her, Stefan rips him away from her and tosses him to the ground. Noah gets up from the floor.]

Damon: Hey, dickhead. [Noah looks back at Damon, who has a stake in his hand.] Nobody wants to kill you. We just wanna talk.
[Noah smiles and rushes back towards Elena. Damon throws the stake to Stefan, who grabs it and stakes Noah in the stomach. Noah grunts and falls to his knees. Damon walks over towards Elena and Stefan so they can interrogate Noah.]

Stefan: Now you feel like talkin'?
Noah: Screw you.
[Stefan digs the stake in deeper. Noah groans in pain.]

Stefan: Wrong answer. Why are you doing this?
Noah: Because it's fun.
[Stefan digs the stake in a little bit more.]

Stefan: What do you want with Elena?
Noah: She looks like Katherine.
[Stefan, Elena, and Damon all look shocked.]

Damon: You knew Katherine?
Noah: Oh. You thought you were the only ones. [laughs and gasps] You don't even remember me.
[Damon leans over towards Noah.]

Damon: Tell me how to get in the tomb. Hmm?
Noah: No.
[Stefan leans back down and drives the stake in deeper.]

Noah: The grimoire.
Damon: Where is it?
[Stefan drives the stake in deeper. Noah gasps.]

Noah: Check the journal. The journal. Johnathan's journal. Johnathan Gilbert's.
[Outside of the cafeteria, Anna looks in, looking helplessly as Noah is tortured. Damon stands up and grimaces.]

Stefan: Who else is working with you?
[Out in the hallways, a door open. Anna hears this and runs off before she is caught. Alaric appears from down the corridor and walks towards the cafeteria.]

Damon: Who else is there?
Noah: No. You're gonna have to kill me.
[Damon looks at Stefan, rolls his eyes, and nods. Stefan removes the stake from Noah's stomach. Stefan waits for a moment then stakes Noah in the heart. Elena gasps in shock. Noah falls to the floor and begins to desiccate.]

Elena: What do we...how are you gonna find the others now?
Damon: He had to die.
Elena: But...
Stefan: Elena, he's been invited in.
[They hear a door open and see Alaric coming through one of the door's windows. Stefan looks at Damon.]

Stefan: Go. I got this.
[Damon walks out of the cafeteria. Stefan wraps his arm around Elena, comforting her. Outside, Alaric is quickly walking down another corridor. Damon turns the corner and sees him. He vamp speeds in front of Alaric and Alaric stops abruptly.]

Alaric: [clears throat] Hey.
[Damon starts to compel Alaric.]

Damon: What were you doing?
Alaric: Looking for Ms. Hilden.
Damon: Why are you in Mystic Falls?
Alaric: I got a job as a teacher.
Damon: Do you know what I am?
Alaric: You're my student's brother.
Damon: Is everything you're telling me the truth?
Alaric: Yes.
Damon: Then forget we had this conversation.
[Damon walks away. Alaric stands still for a moment, shaken by the encounter, he looks down at his closed hand and opens it, revealing that he has vervain.]

[Stefan and Damon are leaning against a doorway, facing each other, in a corridor, as they talk about the night's events.]

Damon: There's no way that idiot was workin' alone.
Stefan: You are. [Damon grimaces at him.] So the grimoire...That was Emily's, right? That's what you need to reverse the spell. When the founding families burned her, they took her things, and you were hoping that dad's journal would tell you where it is.
Damon: Look at you puttin' the pieces together. Good for you. I was half-right. Well, it's out there now. Let the games begin.
Stefan: My offer still stands.
Damon: Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no doubt.
Stefan: No. Nothing hidden about it. No lies. No deception. I'm there when you open up that tomb, you and Katherine go, and the other 26 vampires die.
Damon: If I agree?
Stefan: I'll help you.
Damon: Why should I trust you?
Stefan: Because I'm your brother.
Damon: No, that's not gonna cut it.
Stefan: Because I want you gone.
[Damon pauses for a moment, thinking if this is an acceptable reason to trust Stefan. Then he nods.]

Damon: Ok.
[Stefan nods, sealing the terms to their agreement.]

Mystic Grill
[Matt is cleaning off a table when Caroline walks up to him.]

Caroline: Look I said something stupid. I'm sorry, but I wasn't even talking about you.
[Matt walks off to clean another table and Caroline follows him.]

Matt: Yes, you were, Caroline. Ben could easily be me. We're just alike.
Caroline: That's not true. Are you seriously mad about this? Matt, you know me. Ok, I say stupid things without thinking, and then I have to apologize and take it back, and...I'm a terrible, awful person, but I'm working on it.
Matt: Look, can we just not do this right now?
Caroline: Ok. When do you get off?
Matt: Look, this thing that we've got, it's nice, and it feels really good, and I know you want to take the next step.
Caroline: How do you know that? Have you even asked me?
Matt: I'm...I'm not over Elena. I mean, I don't know if I am, but if we go there, then it could mess things up, and we might lose this, and this is the only good thing I've got going for me right now. So if it doesn't work, I'll just disappoint you and hurt you, and I don't wanna do that.
Caroline: Well, big problem, Matt, because you took the next step all by yourself, and you played the whole thing out in your head, and you decided to bail before even giving it a shot. So this really great thing that we have, don't worry about losing it, 'cause it's already gone.
[Caroline storms out of the Grill. Matt looks displeased with himself as he watches her go.]

Gilbert Residence
[Alaric and Jenna walk up the stairs of the front porch and stop outside the front door. Jenna hands Alaric his letter men jacket which she had slung over her shoulder.]

Jenna: Thank you. I needed that.
Alaric: Well, thank you for, for coming. I...I really appreciate it. You made the evening much more...Well, you made it, period.
Jenna: I'm glad I could help.
Alaric: And thank you for putting up with all that wife talk. I...I gotta stop doin' that. It doesn't bode well for dating.
Jenna: Is that what this was, a date?
Alaric: No, definitely not a date.
Jenna: Oh.
Alaric: But Friday...You, me, and dinner and a movie, that could be a date. How about it?
Jenna: [smiles] Works for me. [laughs] Uh, you can talk about your wife all you want. It's gonna take time to heal. We should just be ourselves.
Alaric: Still, I think I'll keep the Isobel talk to a minimum.
Jenna: Isobel?
Alaric: Yeah. That was her name.
Jenna: Where was Isobel from?
Alaric: Virginia. I mean, not too- -not too far from here, actually.
[Jenna looks at Alaric as if something has clicked into place.]

Mystic Falls
[Caroline walks down a street, her arms folded across her chest. Matt drives up in his truck and yells to her.]

Matt: Caroline!
[Caroline looks over at him, but continues walking.]

Matt: Care, get in the truck.
[Caroline scoffs and continues to walk. Matt stops the truck, puts it into park, and jumps out. Caroline starts to cross the street in front of Matt's truck as Matt runs towards her. Caroline unfolds her arms.]

Caroline: [angrily] What?
[Matt takes Caroline's face in his hands and kisses her. He pulls away, but keeps his hands on her face.]

Matt: This'll never work.
[They both smile and proceed to kiss again and again.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena sits on the couch, pulling her scarf through her hands. Stefan is in the kitchen, making tea for Elena.]

Stefan: Doing ok?
[Elena turns around and looks at him.]

Elena: Is it weird if I say yes?
Stefan: Is it true?
Elena: I should feel more upset or scared or something, but I...feel kind of exhilarated.
Stefan: It's the adrenaline. You'll crash soon enough.
[Stefan walks back into the living room.]

Elena: Yeah, I guess. [smiles and says proudly] I fought back tonight. It felt good.
Stefan: I wish you didn't have to fight at all.
Elena: Still...
[Stefan sits down next to Elena and hands her the mug of tea which she gratefully takes. Elena puts the mug to her lips to take a sip. Stefan turns to her and places his hand on her leg.]

Stefan: I need to tell you something, and I don't know how you're gonna feel about it.
[Elena pulls the mug away from her mouth and looks concerned.]

Elena: What?
Stefan: I told Damon that I'd help him get into that tomb to get Katherine back. But it was a lie. I let him believe that he could trust me.
Elena: Well, then why would you be worried about telling me?
Stefan: Because he can be very persuasive, and you two have bonded lately.
Elena: [scoffs] That doesn't mean I trust him. It's gonna take a lot more than just a road trip and a rescue for me to forget who Damon is and everything he's done.
Stefan: I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena, but I can't let him do it.
Elena: Then don't, and I'll help you, whatever it takes. Ok?
Stefan: Ok. Come here.
[Stefan wraps his arms around Elena and pulls her in. Elena snuggles into Stefan's shoulder.]

Mystic Grill
[Ben exits the Grill. Across the street, someone watches him. Ben locks the Grill up and starts to walk down the street. Behind him, Anna stands at the corner, her eyes become red and veiny and she vamp speeds at him, opening her mouth to bite him. Ben screams and grabs Anna, pushing her against a wall. Ben is revealed to also be a vampire.]

Ben McKittrick: Don't sneak up on me.
Anna: You love it.
[Anna pushes Ben off of her, playfully.]

Ben McKittrick: Where's Noah?
Anna: His obsession got the best of him, and so did the Salvatore brothers.
Ben McKittrick: They killed him?
Anna: Tortured and staked.
Ben McKittrick: You're not very upset.
Anna: I warned him, Ben, and he was just gonna screw everything up anyway. Let's be honest, he wasn't exactly an asset. How'd you do?
Ben McKittrick: Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me. Did you get the journal?
Anna: No, but I know where it is, and I'll get it.
[They smile at each other, then Ben leans down and kisses Anna. They pull apart and continue to smile at one another. Ben places his arm around Anna's shoulder and they walk off down the street together.]

Mystic Falls 1864
[A horse drawn carriage with a driver and his passenger are heading down a dirt road. Up ahead, in the middle of the road, lies a man with a woman kneeling beside him. The woman gets up when she sees the carriage and starts shouting.]

Katherine: Please! Please, help us!
[Katherine runs toward the carriage as it comes to a halt.]

Katherine: Please, my husband, he's been hurt! Please help him!
[The driver jumps down from his seat and goes to check on the man in the road. The passenger of the vehicle opens the carriage door and exits.]

Man: What are you doing out here in the middle of the night? It's not safe.
Katherine: No. No, sir. It's not safe.
[Katherine bares her fangs and bites the man's neck. The man screams as Katherine drains the life out of him. Meanwhile, the driver is kneeling over Damon's body, but turns around when he hears screaming. He sees his passenger's dead body lying by the carriage, but does not see Katherine. He looks back the other way and Katherine has appeared right in front of him. Her eyes become red and she drains the blood from the man who screams for his life. She tosses him aside when she has drained him, blood drenching her chin.]

Katherine: And that's how it's done.
[Katherine wipes the front of her dress with her palms. Damon slowly and cautiously gets up and looks at the two dead men.]

Damon: What happens to the bodies?
Katherine: Well, I'll take them into the woods and the other animals will finish them off. [Damon seems frightened] Are you sure you're ready for this?
Damon: [nods] I'm ready. I want you to turn me.
Katherine: When it's time. Kiss me.
[Damon pulls a handkerchief from his coat pocket with a flourish. He moves to wipe the blood off Katherine's chin, but Katherine grabs his hand and moves in closer.]

Katherine: You should get a taste.
[Katherine moves in to kiss Damon, but Damon moves away.]

Damon: Sorry.
Katherine: Don't be. Soon you won't be able to get enough.
[Damon hesitates for a moment before kissing Katherine with a fiery passion. Damon pulls away and the blood from Katherine's chin has smudge on Damon's lips which Katherine wipes at with her finger.]

[TITLE CARD AND OPENING CREDITS]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan and Elena are snuggled up spooning in Stefan's bed. Elena awakens and Stefan wakes up shortly after this and kisses Elena on the cheek as Elena pulls his arm tighter around her.]

Elena: Mmm. Good morning.
Stefan: I could get used to this.
Damon: Rise and shine, sleepyheads.
[Elena and Stefan both sit up, startled at Damon's presence at the end of Stefan's bed. Both of them pull the sheets up to their chins, covering up any parts they may not want Damon to see.]

Elena: Damon! Please!
Stefan: What are you doing?
Damon: Oh, stop being smutty.
[Stefan pulls the sheets further up on Elena, making sure she's covered up properly.]

Stefan: Seriously, get out of here!
Damon: If I see something I haven't seen before, I'll throw a dollar at it. Now listen, we have some very important business to discuss.
Elena: And it has to be right now?
Damon: Well, we have lots to do, now that we're all friends and working toward a common goal.
[Stefan and Elena exchange looks. Damon gets up from the end of the bed and turns around to face them.]

Damon: So, in order to open the tomb, we need to find the journal to get the grimoire to undo the spells. First things first-since you are Elena Gilbert, you're on journal duty.
Elena: Since when am I helping?
Damon: Well, Stefan's helping, and you've taken up residence in Stefan's bed, ergo...
Stefan: You don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.
Elena: I'll look for it tonight.
[Elena lays back down in the bed, pulling the sheets over her face.]

Damon: Good.
Stefan: How do we know that this journal will hold the location of the grimoire? We're really going to take the word of this vampire? He seemed like a bit of a dimwit
Damon: In lieu of any other options.
[Elena pulls the sheets down and sits up suddenly.]

Elena: OK, what exactly is a grimoire, anyway?
Damon: It's a witch's cookbook.
Stefan: Every spell that a witch casts is unique unto itself, so every witch would document their work.
Damon: Yeah. Cookbook.
Stefan: What about our mystery vampire? Dimwit obviously wasn't working alone, so whoever's out there knows who we are.
Damon: And I don't like that disadvantage, so...[claps his hands together] Chop, chop. [starts to walk out of the room, turns around, and continues to walk backwards out of the room while talking to Elena and Stefan] You know, I really like this whole menage a threesome team thing. It's got a bit of a kink to it. [He chuckles.] Don't screw it up.
[Damon exits the room. After a second, Elena looks over at Stefan.]

Elena: He doesn't--
[Stefan places his finger to his lips and points to the door then his ear, indicating that Damon could still hear them.]

Elena: Oh, right, yeah.
[Stefan grabs Elena's hand and kisses it, then starts to get out of bed.]

Stefan: OK.
[Elena pulls Stefan back into bed.]

Elena: Oh! No, come here.
[Elena kisses Stefan.]

Stefan: We shouldn't-
Elena: Shh.
[Elena places her finger to his lips, then points to her ear, as Stefan did earlier. They both smile and continue to kiss each other as they pull the covers over their heads and begin to have what is referred to as morning sex.]

Salvatore Estate 1864
[Katherine and Damon are under the covers in Katherine's bed. Katherine giggles loudly.]

Katherine: What are you doing? Stop it!
[Katherine pulls the covers down and Damon pops up next to her, wrapping his arm around her waist.]

Damon: Make me.
[Katherine rolls Damon over and straddles him, baring her fangs and hissing. Damon looks up at her with curiosity. He caresses her face and she places her hand on top of his, smiling down at him. Suddenly, someone knocks on the door.]

Katherine: Yes?
[Katherine retracts her fangs and her eyes become normal again. She turns her head to see who's entering, but remains on top of Damon, pinning his wrists down with her hands. Emily enters the room.]

Emily: Excuse me, Miss Katherine. Miss Pearl is here to see you.
Katherine: I'll be down soon. Please ask her to wait.
[Emily waits to be dismissed.]

Katherine: Thank you, Emily.
[Emily exits the room, shutting the door behind her. Katherine looks down at Damon, pouting her bottom lip.]

Katherine: Fun's over.
Damon: Hmm, no.
[Damon caresses Katherine's face and Katherine leans down and kisses him.]

[Downstairs, Pearl is waiting for Katherine. Katherine descends the stairs, fully dressed, smiling at Pearl.]

Katherine: It's good to see you, Pearl.
Pearl: Perhaps we could talk outside.
[Katherine turns to look at Emily who is standing behind Pearl.]

Katherine: Emily, would you please tell Mr. Salvatore that I've stepped away?
Emily: Which one?
Katherine: [smirking] Both.
[Emily walks up the stairs as Pearl and Katherine exit the house. They walk down the porch steps and across the yard.]

Pearl: How long do you plan on staying with the Salvatores? People talk, Katherine. You, carrying on with both brothers, doesn't help the situation.
Katherine: The Salvatores have been kind to take me in. As far as everyone here knows, I'm a poor orphan girl from Atlanta, lost her family in the fires.
Pearl: A match you lit, no doubt.
[Katherine giggles. The two stop at the end of the yard. Pearl looks over at a young girl and shouts to her.]

Pearl: Honey, please be careful!
[The young girl goes over to pet a horse. Katherine looks back then turns to face Pearl. They carry on with their conversation.]

Pearl: Honoria Fell came by the apothecary yesterday with a case of this elixir. [She retrieves a bottle of liquid from her bag and shows it to Katherine.] She asked that it be sold at a reduced rate.
Katherine: I don't follow.
Pearl: Try it.
[Katherine takes the bottle, uncorks it, and sniffs it. She then places the rim of the glass on the palm of her hand and gasps as it burns her.]

Katherine: What in hell?!
Pearl: Vervain.
Katherine: Why is there ver, [sighs], they know.
Pearl: They're trying to find us, and they're getting crafty about it.
Katherine: The townspeople ingesting vervain? Well, that's inconvenient.
[Katherine hands the bottle of liquid vervain back to Pearl.]

Pearl: It might be time for us to move on again.
Katherine: No. I like it here. I'm not interested in leaving just yet.
[Anna trots over to Katherine and Pearl.]

Anna: Can we go, Mama?
[Katherine and Pearl look back at her. Anna senses something.]

Anna: Is something wrong?
[Katherine and Pearl do not respond.]

Motel Room
[Anna is lying in a motel bed, her phone to her ear, as she leaves a message for Jeremy.]

Anna: Hey, it's me again. Anna. Stalker chick and Foosball champion. I'll be at the Grill later, if you want, you know, a rematch, or whatever.
[Ben exits the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. He looks over at Anna as he dries his hair with another towel. Anna hangs up her phone.]

Ben McKittrick: Who are you calling?
Anna: Jeremy Gilbert.
Ben McKittrick: You're not, like, into him, are you?
Anna: I need him for something. Get over it.
[Ben walks over to the window and pulls the curtain back. The sun burns him, his skin starts to smoke, and he reacts quickly.]

Ben McKittrick: Oh! Mmm! Damn it!
Anna: Dude, you gotta stop doing that.
Ben McKittrick: I know. I just-I keep forgetting.
Anna: You're new. You'll get it.
[Ben sees an open journal lying next to Anna and picks it up. He lies in the bed next to her as he examines the contents.]

Ben McKittrick: You found the Gilbert journal?
Anna: Does that look like the Gilbert journal?
Ben McKittrick: Well, it's old and musty, and how am I supposed to know the difference?
Anna: I don't know, I figured maybe, just maybe, you've been paying a little bit of attention since we met.
Ben McKittrick: [scoffs] You know, you don't have to talk down to me. I'm not stupid.
[Anna gets up and walks over to the mini fridge. She extracts a bottle of blood and walks back over to Ben, sitting down on the edge of the bed, and handing him the blood.]

Anna: Here. Drink. I don't want you getting itchy around the witch. She can sense if you're weak.
[Ben uncaps the bottle and gulps down the blood. He scrunches his face up as he examines the bottle.]

Ben McKittrick: When can we go hunting again? This tastes old. I want fresh blood.
Anna: When we get that tomb open, you can kill anyone you want. For now, just stay focused on Bonnie while I try to get the journal back from Jeremy's teacher.
Ben McKittrick: Why did you choose me?
Anna: I needed someone in a position to be my eyes and ears. Small town bartender fit the bill.
Ben McKittrick: There are plenty of bartenders to choose from. Why me?
Anna: You were sad, Ben. You lacked purpose. You needed me.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena is combing through boxes of old family memorabilia. Stefan sits at the breakfast bar, watching Elena.]

Elena: Do you think Damon really believes us? That we're both trying to help him?
Stefan: I don't think Damon knows what to believe. Trust isn't something that comes naturally to him.
Elena: You know...I really think that Damon believes that everything he's done, every move that he's made, he's done for love. It's twisted, but kind of sad.
Stefan: There are other ways to get what you want. You don't have to kill people. Damon has no regard for human life. He enjoys inflicting pain on others. For 145 years, every single time that I have let my guard down and let Damon back into my life, he's done something to make me regret that. I'm not going to make that mistake again.
Elena: So what do you think will happen if the tomb gets opened and Damon gets Katherine back?
Stefan: I think that no matter what Damon promises, a lot of people will die.
[Elena exhales loudly and picks up a photo from the box. Stefan gets up and stands behind Elena, examining the photo.]

Stefan: That's Johnathan Gilbert.
[Elena looks down into the box, puzzled.]

Elena: What's this?
[Elena opens up a wooden box. What appears to be a muzzle is contained within it. Stefan looks as if he recognizes the device, but doesn't explain as Jeremy enters the room shortly after.]

Jeremy: What are you guys doing?
Elena: Hey. Just going through some stuff, feeling sentimental. Dad had this old family journal from years ago. I thought I'd dig it up.
[Jeremy sits down on the kitchen counter.]

Jeremy: Johnathan Gilbert's journal?
Elena: Yeah, what do you know about it?
Jeremy: I just did a history report on it.
Elena: Oh. So where is it now?
Jeremy: I gave it to Mr. Saltzman. He wanted to see it.
[Elena and Stefan exchange looks.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric is sitting in a dark classroom at his desk, poring over the contents of the Gilbert journal. Only a single lamp lights the pages as he reads from it.]

Alaric: [voiceover, reading from the journal] I met Barnette and Giuseppe this evening. I saw the skepticism in their eyes when I showed them the compass.
Salvatore Estate 1864
[Giuseppe Salvatore, Barnette Lockwood and Johnathan Gilbert are in the study, looking at the compass and discussing it.]

Giuseppe: We're supposed to believe that can track one of them?
Barnette: What is it, magic?
Johnathan: It's science.
Barnette: I'll believe it when I see it.
Giuseppe: I've been thinking about this church idea. I believe it could work.
[Stefan opens the door to the study and is startled by the appearance of the company. They all turn and look at Stefan.]

Stefan: Excuse me, father. I didn't know you had guests.
Giuseppe: We'll be done in a few minutes, son.
Stefan: I'll come back. Forgive me, Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Lockwood.
[Stefan shuts the door behind him.]

Johnathan: Have you told them?
Giuseppe: Not yet.
Johnathan: Giuseppe, we need all the men we can get.
Giuseppe: I'll tell them. You can count on both my boys.
Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric has taken the journal to the teacher's lounge to make copies. He takes the printed pages and the journal off the copier and walks over to a locker to place the printed pages in. Out in the dark hallway, Anna walks down the length of the corridor. Alaric closes the locker and walks out of the teacher's lounge and back to his classroom. He tosses the journal onto the desk and sits back down. Alaric grabs some papers in a tray and begins to grade them. Anna rushes past his classroom with vamp-speed. Alaric looks up.]

Alaric: Hello?
[Alaric gets up and goes out into the hallway to look around.]

Alaric: Hello?
[Anna is hiding behind a wall, close by, waiting.]

Alaric: Someone there?
[Alaric turns to his right and begins to walk down the corridor, giving Anna the opportunity to vamp-speed into his classroom. Alaric turns around and quickly walks off to the teacher's lounge. He opens his locker and takes out a duffel bag which he retrieves a blow dart gun from, modified to use wooden stakes. Alaric takes one of the wooden stakes and inserts it into the blow gun. He cocks the gun and walks back to his classroom. Before entering, he hides up against the wall out in the corridor next to the classroom door. Swiftly, he turns into the doorway, points the gun, and shoots the dart. Stefan, without effort, grabs the stake and stares at Alaric. Alaric begins to reload another stake into the gun as Stefan watches him. Alaric looks down and cocks the gun, moving towards the doorway as he does so. Stefan vamp-speeds around him and blocks his way. Alaric looks up at him and Stefan grabs him by his shirt.]

Stefan: You shouldn't have done that.
[Stefan pushes Alaric into the desk and takes the gun from him. Alaric scrambles up from the floor, ready to fight.]

Stefan: Have a seat.
[Alaric hesitates, but Stefan points at a chair, insisting that he does as he is told. Alaric sits down in a desk. Stefan examines the gun.]

Stefan: What is this, compressed air? [Alaric doesn't respond] Did you make it yourself? Who are you? [Stefan moves closer to Alaric, who flinches.] I'm not going to hurt you...unless you try that again.
[Stefan hands Alaric the gun and Alaric takes it. Stefan pulls one of the desk upright and sits on top of it, looking at Alaric.]

Stefan: Now...who are you?
Alaric: I'm a teacher.
Stefan: Are we gonna have to do this the hard way?
Alaric: I'm also a historian. And while researching Virginia, I--made a few discoveries about your town.
Stefan: So you show up like Van Helsing. Come on. Tell me the truth.
Alaric: My wife was a parapsychologist. She spent her life researching paranormal activity in this area. It was her work that led me here.
Stefan: Where's your wife?
Alaric: Dead. A vampire killed her.
Stefan: Where's the Gilbert journal?
Alaric: What do you want with it?
Stefan: Where is it?
Alaric: It's on my desk.
Stefan: No, it's not.
[Alaric looks over at his desk and sees that the journal is missing. He looks back at Stefan.]

Alaric: It was on my desk.
Motel Room
[Anna is looking through the journal, while Ben gets ready for his date with Bonnie. Ben stands up and walks over to Anna.]

Ben McKittrick: Anything?
Anna: Not yet. Just a lot of gibberish. Yeah, some people just shouldn't journal.
Ben McKittrick: I thought this Gilbert was the brains.
[Ben leans over to look at the journal. Anna looks up at him.]

Anna: Don't you have a date?
Ben McKittrick: Yep. Wish me luck.
[Ben moves in to kiss Anna, but Anna pushes him away, not taking her eyes off the journal. Anna continues to read on as Ben walks out of the room.]

Johnathan: [voiceover] I saw her again today--The most beautiful woman in town, with a name just as pretty: Pearl.
Apothecary 1864
[Katherine is whiffing various perfumes as Pearl speaks to her.]

Pearl: Have you thought any more of what I've said?
Katherine: We'll leave soon, Pearl, I promise. I need to take care of a few things first.
Pearl: You're going to turn both of them, aren't you?
[Katherine looks at Pearl, mischievously.]

Pearl: Katherine, please. Be careful.
Katherine: We'll all be safe, I promise.
[Katherine looks over Pearl's shoulder and sees Johnathan entering.]

Katherine: Mr. Gilbert's coming. Quick, your cheeks. [Katherine pinches Pearl's cheeks] Perfectly rosy.
[Johnathan stands in the doorway and Pearl turns to look at him.]

Johnathan: Miss Pearl. May I have a moment?
Pearl: Yes, Mr. Gilbert. I'm still waiting for you to explain that comet in the sky.
[Johnathan and Pearl leave together.]

Katherine: [to Anna] Your mother has an admirer.
[Anna and Emily smile.]

Salvatore Estate 1864
[Giuseppe, Damon, and Stefan walk together across their property and converse.]

Giuseppe: As descendants of the Founding Families, they'll want to know that they can count on you.
Stefan: Of course they can. Is there any doubt?
Giuseppe: I'm not sure your brother Damon understands the importance of duty.
Stefan: Damon left the Confederacy on principle. It was his choice and should be respected.
Giuseppe: You'll forgive me if I have trouble respecting a deserter.
Damon: Well, I never asked for your respect.
[Giuseppe stops and faces Damon, who halts in front of his father.]

Giuseppe: Good for you, Damon. Because all I have is disappointment.
[Stefan feels the tension in the air and changes the topic.]

Stefan: You said the town is in trouble?
Giuseppe: There's been too many deaths. It is time for us to fight back and stop these killers.
Stefan: Killers? What are you talking about?
Giuseppe: We live amongst demons.
Damon: You're being cryptic now, father. Why don't you just say the word?
Giuseppe: Vampires. They exist. And they live amongst us. But we have a plan to kill them. And you're going to help us.
[Giuseppe looks at Stefan, who nods, understandingly. Giuseppe then looks at Damon. Damon does not make a move to indicate what he's thinking.]

Gilbert Residence
[Damon is slicing a tomato and talking to Jenna, who is sitting on a counter with a glass of wine in hand.]

Damon: My father never approved of anyone I dated, which only made me want them more. Of course. What about you?
Jenna: There were a few guys. Logan isn't the only loser I've dated.
Damon: They ever find him? Or is he still missing?
Jenna: He's not missing. He's in the Bahamas working on his tan. Very entitled, that one. Marches to his own drum. [Jenna drains the remainder of her wine.] He's a Fell. They're all snooty.
[Damon chuckles and walks over to Jenna, pouring more wine into her glass. She raises her glass to him and Damon turns back around to continue cooking.]

Damon: Hello, Elena.
[Jenna turns around right when Elena enters the kitchen. She is shocked to see Damon there.]

Jenna: Hey. Where have you been? We're cooking dinner.
Damon: Is Stefan with you?
Elena: Um - he'll be here soon.
[Elena leans against the counter which Jenna is sitting on and watches Damon with distaste.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Stefan and Alaric are still conversing in Alaric's classroom.]

Stefan: How long have you been aware of me?
Alaric: I learned just recently. What about your brother?
Stefan: You met Damon.
Alaric: Who do you think killed my wife?
Stefan: Are you certain it was Damon?
Alaric: I witnessed it.
Stefan: If you're here for revenge, this is going to end very badly for you.
Alaric: I just want to find out what happened to my wife.
Stefan: I thought you just said that Damon...
Alaric: Yeah. I saw him draining the life out of her. He must have heard me coming. He just...disappeared. So did her body. They never found her.
Stefan: Damon can never know why you're here. He'll kill you without blinking.
Alaric: I can take care of myself.
Stefan: [scoffs] No, you can't. I can help you. If you let me.
Gilbert Residence
[Damon places something at the dinner table and heads back to the kitchen. Elena is carrying plates towards the table and Damon deliberately bumps into her.]

Damon: Whoa. Mmm.
[Elena smiles in an annoyed way and shakes her head as she continues on past Damon to place the plates at the table.]

Elena: Don't do that.
Damon: Do what?
Elena: You know what. That move was deliberate.
Damon: Well, yeah, I was deliberately trying to get to the sink.
[Elena looks back at Damon and scoffs. Damon, now at the stove, stirs a boiling pot of water.]

Damon: Speaking of Stefan, where is he? He's missing family night, which I am enjoying immensely.
[Elena walks back into the kitchen to gather more dinnerware. Damon pauses briefly before changing the topic.]

Damon: Is it real?
Elena: Is what real?
Damon: This renewed sense of brotherhood. [He takes the spoon out of the pot and tastes the sauce] Can I trust him?
Elena: [looks boldly at him] Yes, you can trust him.
[Elena walks back to the table to place the napkins. Damon vamp-speeds over to her. Elena turns around and looks up at him.]

Damon: Can I trust him?
Elena: I'm wearing vervain, Damon. It's not going to work.
Damon: I'm not compelling you. I just want you to answer me. Honestly.
Elena: Of course you can.
[Elena moves around Damon and back into the kitchen.]

Salvatore Estate 1864
[Giuseppe and Katherine are playing croquet in the garden.]

Katherine: You can trust me, Mr. Salvatore. I would never cheat.
[Katherine hits the ball with her mallet, knocking it through the bridge. Giuseppe sighs and Katherine giggles devilishly. Damon and Stefan approach the pair.]

Giuseppe: [to Damon and Stefan] I'm losing over here. Again!
[Giuseppe takes his turn at the game and Katherine curtseys at Damon and Stefan. Damon and Stefan stop walking and observe the game.]

Damon: She's good. I almost believe she genuinely likes him.
Stefan: Perhaps she does.
Damon: [scoffs] She knows father would have her killed if he knew the truth.
Stefan: Not if we talk to him; explained how we feel. He could help us keep her safe.
[Damon turns his body towards Stefan and faces him fully.]

Damon: Have you gone mad? No, no, father would drive the stake in her himself!
Stefan: That's not true. We can trust him.
Damon: No, no, not with this. Please, promise me you won't tell him, Stefan.
[Damon grips Stefan's shoulder. Katherine watches them from across the garden, her smile faltering. They look over at her.]

Stefan: I promise.
Gilbert Residence
Damon: There was a time when I trusted him more than anyone.
Elena: Trust breeds trust. You have to give it to get it.
Damon: Are you lecturing me?
Elena: [places hand on hip] Do you need to be lectured?
Damon: I just want her back. I'm sure you can understand that.
Elena: I can understand that you would do anything for her, yes.
[Elena walks past Damon and places a bowl on the table. Damon threateningly makes his next statement, close behind Elena's back.]

Damon: Then you understand what I will do if anyone gets in my way.
[Damon walks away, leaving Elena looking disturbed.]

[Later on, Damon and Jeremy are sitting in the family room playing a video game.]

Jeremy: You said you never played this thing before.
Damon: I'm a fast learner. Quick reflexes.
[Jeremy's phone goes off. He pauses the game and takes out his phone, but ignores the call, he tosses his phone aside and unpauses the game.]

Damon: Who are you dodging?
Jeremy: This girl Anna. She can be, uh, persistent.
Damon: Is she hot?
Jeremy: Yeah, yeah, but she can be weird.
Damon: Hot trumps weird, trust me.
[Jeremy smiles and laughs.]

[In the kitchen, Jenna and Elena are talking. Damon eavesdrops in on their conversation with his vampire hearing.]

Jenna: [whispers] He is ridiculously hot!
Elena: Shh!
[Damon smirks at Jenna's comment.]

Elena: [looks over at Damon] He's an ass.
[Damon rolls his eyes and stops listening in. Elena continues going through things in a box while Jenna helps out.]

Jenna: What are you doing with all this stuff?
Elena: I thought there might be something about my birth parents.
Jenna: Have you told Jeremy?
Elena: I will. When the time is right.
[Elena closes up the box. The doorbell rings.]

Elena: That's Stefan.
[Damon quickly gets up from the couch and walks over to the door. Jeremy watches him go, agitated.]

Jeremy: Dude!
[Elena opens the front door, Damon right behind her. Stefan looks at Damon, confused to why he's at the house, then to Elena, who shrugs.]

Damon: Well?
Mystic Grill
[Ben and Bonnie are sitting at a table, drinking coffee.]

Ben McKittrick: Admit it. I can't sing.
Bonnie: No. You were great.
Ben McKittrick: Come on, I totally trashed a Metallica song.
Bonnie: Well, first mistake, Metallica karaoke?
Ben McKittrick: Well, at least I could admit it.
Bonnie: The woman with the tattoos loved you.
Ben McKittrick: Yeah, well, next time, I'm going to throw out my Pearl Jam.
Bonnie: Next time?
Ben McKittrick: Yeah. So, uh, what are your friends up to tonight?
Bonnie: They're all doing their own thing. Caroline's at her dad's, Elena's with her boyfriend.
Ben McKittrick: Elena Gilbert, right?
Bonnie: Yeah.
Ben McKittrick: Yeah, I remember. You guys used to hang out.
Bonnie: She's my best friend.
Ben McKittrick: Yeah, my friends, they all moved away after graduation, and I didn't. So we just kind of drifted apart.
Bonnie: Oh. Elena and I are bonded for life. I can't imagine it any other way.
Ben McKittrick: That tight, huh?
Bonnie: She's my sister. I mean, I'd die for her.
[Ben sips his coffee, clearly thinking about Bonnie's love for Elena.]

Gilbert Residence
[Stefan, Damon, and Elena walk out onto the front porch to talk.]

Damon: Who took it?
Stefan: I don't know.
Damon: You know what, it's that teacher. There's something really off about him.
Stefan: No, he doesn't know anything. Somebody got to it right before me.
Damon: Who else knew it was there?
[Stefan looks through the window at Jeremy, but doesn't say anything. Damon looks at Jeremy also and begins to walk back into the house.]

Elena: No. Damon, leave him out of it!
Damon: Why, what's the big deal?
Elena: Damon!
[Damon walks into the house, Elena and Stefan right behind him. Damon sits on the arm of the sofa to speak with Jeremy.]

Damon: So....I heard you found a really cool journal from back in the day. Who else did you show it to?
Jeremy: Huh?
Damon: Don't ask questions, just spill.
Jeremy: [chuckles] You're kidding me, right?
Elena: Jer, did you tell anyone other than Mr. Saltzman about Johnathan Gilbert's journal?
Jeremy: Why is everybody so obsessed with that thing?
Elena: Who else did you tell?
Jeremy: Just that girl Anna.
Damon: The hot, weird one?
Jeremy: Yeah.
Stefan: Wait, who is Anna?
Damon: That's what I want to find out.
[Elena's phone starts ringing. Elena goes off to answer it, leaving Damon to question Jeremy.]

Damon: How do you know her?
Jeremy: I just know her. She wants me to meet her at the Grill tonight.
Damon: Perfect. I'll drive. Come on.
Jeremy: O-Okay.
[Jeremy gets up from the couch and follows Damon out of the house.]

[Elena walks up the stairs and into her room, answering her phone. The scenes flip between Elena and Bonnie, at the Grill, walking away from her table with Ben to speak to Elena more privately.]

Elena: OK, I'm alone. Give me all the deets, Bonnie. I'm dying.
Bonnie: It's going great. He's a perfect gentleman.
Elena: Gentleman, huh?
Bonnie: I know! Boring, huh? I just want to grab him and lay one on him.
Elena: So, why don't you?
Bonnie: 'Cause I'm a chicken.
Elena: [laughs] You're a powerful witch goddess. Come on, seize the day, Broomhilda.
Bonnie: [laughs] Okay. I'm going to text you later with more details.
Elena: You better.
[Elena hangs up. Stefan enters Elena's room. Elena looks at him.]

Elena: Where's Damon?
Stefan: He left to track down Jeremy's friend Anna, see if there was anything there.
Elena: Aren't you going to go with him? If he gets to the journal before we do, then...
[Stefan pulls out a stack of papers.]

Stefan: Doesn't matter.
[Elena looks at the papers in Stefan's hands.]

Elena: What is that?
Stefan: It's a copy of it.
Elena: How did you get it?
Stefan: Well, Mr. Saltzman made a copy and was kind enough to loan it to me.
Elena: [unconvinced] He did?
Stefan: Not exactly, but I got it.
[Elena chuckles.]

Mystic Grill
[Anna walks into the Grill and spots Jeremy, leaning against a pool table.]

Anna: You just couldn't live without me, huh?
Jeremy: Well, I kinda miss my daily dose of cute stalker chick.
Anna: Oh, funny.
Jeremy: Let's play.
[Jeremy and Anna set up the pool table. Damon is at the bar, listening in on them, he looks away with an expression of recognition on his face.]

Apothecary 1864
[It's pouring rain outside. Anna and Emily are out on the front porch. Inside the shop, Pearl is speaking with Katherine and Damon.]

Pearl: The sheriff was here earlier. He bought large volumes of the vervain elixir.
Katherine: Did he try to put his hands on you again?
Pearl: Doesn't he always?
Katherine: [to Damon, linking her arm through his] She's saving herself for Johnathan Gilbert.
Pearl: I'm beyond saving. We know that.
[Katherine chuckles softly. Damon looks at both of them, worried.]

Damon: How can you be so calm? They're getting closer to you every day.
Katherine: We are the respectable ladies of Mystic Falls. Thanks to Emily, we walk the streets in daylight. No one will ever suspect us.
Pearl: [looking at Damon] Not unless a human tells them.
Damon: I'd sooner die.
Katherine: And soon enough, you will.
[Katherine and Damon share a kiss. Anna enters the shop. The three of them look over at her.]

Anna: Mrs. Fell is approaching.
Pearl: Thank you, Annabelle.
[Pearl walks over to Anna and hugs her. Anna smiles and laughs gleefully.]

Mystic Grill
[Damon looks back over at Anna, realizing who she is. Oblivious, Anna smiles and laughs as she plays a game with Jeremy.]

Gilbert Residence
[Stefan and Elena are looking through the copied pages of the journal in Elena's room.]

Elena: Here's a reference that he wrote about Emily. [She reads aloud from the page.] The Fell family believed it should be I, not them, who protected the witch's spell book. But I feared she would haunt me from the hereafter. They mocked my fear, but it was Giuseppe Salvatore who- [She pauses] Is that your father?
[Stefan has sat down next to Elena.]

Stefan: Yeah.
[Stefan takes the pages from Elena and continues to read aloud.]

Stefan: It was Giuseppe Salvatore who removed my fear. He told me he would protect the secret of the spell book. He said he would carry it to his grave.
[Stefan looks up from the pages, his brow furrowed.]

Salvatore Estate 1864
[Giuseppe is in his study, writing in his journal. Stefan gently knocks on the door. Giuseppe looks up at him and places his journal down.]

Giuseppe: Stefan. To what do I owe this pleasure?
Stefan: Did I interrupt your writing?
Giuseppe: These are the dull musings of my troubled mind.
Stefan: A great mind.
Giuseppe: Still. I will carry the real secrets with me-
Stefan: To your grave.
Giuseppe: And a full grave it will be.
[Giuseppe gestures towards the empty chair next to him. Stefan enters the study and sits down in the chair.]

Giuseppe: Now, speaking of troubled minds, what's on yours?
Stefan: I have concerns about your plan for the vampires.
Giuseppe: And why is that?
Stefan: We are making the assumption that all vampires are as evil as they've been characterized, but what if that's not true?
Giuseppe: Do you have any evidence to the contrary? Do you know of any vampires?
Stefan: No. No, of course not. But are we to take what others say at face value? You always taught us so differently.
[Giuseppe gets up and goes to pour himself a drink.]

Giuseppe: Stefan...These creatures are of the darkest parts of Hell. They have the ability to control your mind, seduce your spirit. They are deadly. They must be destroyed. [He hands Stefan a glass of bourbon.] Those who stand with them; those who bring shame to their families will be destroyed as well.
[Giuseppe holds his glass out to Stefan, who clinks his own glass against his father's. They drink, but Stefan looks disconcerted.]

Gilbert Residence
[Stefan has a look of dawning apprehension on his face.]

Stefan: I know where it is.
[Elena looks up at him, impressed with his quick discovery.]

Motel Room
[Anna unlocks the door to the motel room and enters. As she shuts the door, Damon appears behind it. Damon grabs Anna by the throat and vamp speeds her into a wall. Anna also grabs a hold of Damon's throat. Both of them groaning and make choking noises as they tightly hold onto the other's throats.]

Damon: [choking] OK, I give. OK.
[Anna releases him and he releases Anna. Damon coughs and rubs his neck.]

Damon: Damn. You're strong for a little thing.
Anna: I was wondering how long it would take you to find me.
Old Cemetery
[Elena shines a flashlight onto Giuseppe's tombstone. Stefan walks around the grave, setting up torches and taking out supplies.]

Elena: Why isn't your father buried in your family's tomb?
Stefan: It wasn't built until well after he died.
Elena: Are you sure the grimoire's in there with him?
Stefan: As sure as I could be.
Elena: Great.
[Stefan picks two shovels up from the ground and looks at Elena.]

Stefan: Elena. I can do this on my own.
Elena: And I said I would do whatever I can to help.
Stefan: I know, and I appreciate that, but-
Elena: This town is my home, Stefan. My friends and family are here. You're here. I don't want that tomb opened any more than you do.
[Stefan nods and hands Elena a shovel, which she takes. Stefan exhales heavily and takes a moment to gather himself.]

Elena: I'm sorry that you have to do this.
Salvatore Estate 1864
[Katherine is sitting at her vanity, examining a necklace. Stefan watches her from the bed.]

Stefan: What is that?
Katherine: A gift.
Stefan: From Damon?
Katherine: From Emily, actually. And when will you stop worrying about Damon?
[Katherine walks back over to Stefan, placing a shawl around her shoulders.]

Stefan: I want you all to myself.
Katherine: Just as he wants me, but I'm the one who gets to make all the rules.
Stefan: And why is that?
Katherine: Because I'm spoiled.
Stefan: Yes, you are.
[Katherine inches closer to Stefan and pushes him back down on the bed.]

Katherine: And selfish.
[Katherine stradles Stefan.]

Katherine: And because I can do this.
[Katherine runs her hand up Stefan's chest and he moans. She kisses his stomach.]

Katherine: And this.
[Katherine kisses up Stefan's chest. Stefan shuts his eyes and sighs pleasantly. Katherine kisses Stefan's neck and inches her face closer towards his.]

Katherine: And this.
[Katherine's eyes become red and she extends her fangs, biting into Stefan's shoulder. Stefan groans loudly as Katherine holds him down. Suddenly, Katherine starts gasping for air and pulls away from Stefan. Stefan sits up and looks at Katherine, worried.]

Stefan: What? What?
Katherine: Vervain.
Stefan: What?
[Katherine falls off the bed and onto the floor. Katherine gasps and chokes. Stefan jumps off the bed and kneels down next to Katherine, grabbing her face in his hands.]

Stefan: Katherine! Katherine!
[Giuseppe bursts through the door. Stefan looks up at him in shock.]

Giuseppe: Go get the sheriff. Tell him we have a vampire.
Stefan: What? No!
Giuseppe: Do as I say, son! Nothing that you feel for her is real. She's a vampire, Stefan! A monster! I fed you vervain hoping that it would expose her.
Stefan: How did you know?
Giuseppe: Your sympathy for their plight. I didn't raise my sons to be so weak. [He throws Stefan a shirt.] The sheriff, now. Go, quickly! Now, son!
[Stefan hesitates and looks down at Katherine. Stefan stands up and runs out of the room, leaving Giuseppe alone with the weakend Katherine.]

Old Cemetery
[Stefan and Elena are shoveling up the dirt, digging deeper and deeper into Giuseppe's grave.]

Motel Room
[Anna places her bag on the counter and sits down, looking at Damon.]

Damon: How long have you been here?
Anna: I arrived around half-past comet, watching you screw up every chance you had to open that tomb.
Damon: How did you know about the spell?
Anna: I didn't say much back then, which means I heard everything.
[Damon moves closer to Anna, trying to intimidate her.]

Damon: So if you've been here the whole time, then why are we just crossing paths right now?
[Anna gets up and walks around the room.]

Anna: I like to use others to do my dirty work.
Damon: Like Logan Fell? Oh, yeah, thanks for that, by the way. Little bastard shot me.
Anna: Logan was an idiot.
Damon: Mm-hmm.
Anna: We slipped him some blood when he started getting all poser slayer with that compass. I needed his family's journal. I couldn't let him die.
Damon: What'd you want with the Fell journal?
Anna: I thought it contained the location of the witch's spell book. I was wrong. According to her journal, Honoria gave the grimoire to Johnathan Gilbert. And, according to this...
[Anna walks over towards the counter, opens her bag, and takes out the Gilbert journal.]

Anna: He gave it to your father. So now you're going to help me find it.
Damon: Why would I help you?
Anna: 'Cause you and I both want that tomb open.
[Anna hands the journal to Damon who reads the page Anna flipped it to.]

Damon: Hmm. [He shuts the journal and places it back on the counter.] Sorry. I work alone.
[Damon exits the motel room]

Mystic Grill
[Ben walks over to Bonnie, the pair of them getting ready to leave.]

Ben McKittrick: Well, the check's paid. I'm all yours tonight. What do you want to do?
Bonnie: This.
[Bonnie kisses Ben, but after a moment she pulls away quickly, looking at him with fear.]

Ben McKittrick: What's wrong?
Bonnie: Nothing. Sorry. I just should have waited until the end of the night to do that.
Ben McKittrick: I didn't mind.
Bonnie: [chuckles] You know, I'm starting to get tired.
Ben McKittrick: Do you want go?
Bonnie: I was going to say let's have some more coffee, get a caffeine buzz, and, I don't know, go out and do something crazy.
Ben McKittrick: Hmm, like what?
Bonnie: Like anything.
Ben McKittrick: Okay.
Bonnie: I'm going to run to the restroom.
Ben McKittrick: Okay.
Bonnie: All right.
[Ben sits back down at the table as Bonnie takes her jacket back off. Bonnie heads towards the restroom, looking back at Ben, she quickens her pace and glances back to make sure Ben isn't following her. She turns her head back around, still walking quickly, but Ben has blocked the entrance to the restroom, his face in its full vampire form. Bonnie gasps, but before she can scream, Ben claps a hand over her mouth and drags her into the restroom, without anyone noticing.]

Old Cemetery
[Stefan continues to shovel the dirt out of the grave. Elena stands beside the deep hole, beaming the flashlight down so Stefan can see what he is doing. Elena smiles and starts shaking her head. Stefan looks up at her.]

Stefan: What?
Elena: Not many girls can say they've done this.
[Stefan continues to dig. His shovel hits something solid and it makes a loud thud. Stefan looks up at Elena with apprehension. He scraps the dirt off of the coffin with the shovel and tosses the shovel out of the grave. Stefan kneels down on the coffin, wiping the dirt away with his hands. Elena kneels down to get a better look, holding the beam steady. Stefan opens the lid of the coffin. Elena breathes heavily.]

Elena: Is that it?
[Stefan retrieves the grimoire, which is cradled in his father's arms. He shuts the lid of the coffin and tries to regain his composure, his eyes watery. Stefan stands up and places the grimoire on the dirt next to Elena. Elena kneels down, shining the beam on the grimoire and Stefan rips the cover off. Stefan carefully turns the pages of the grimoire, looking for the spell.]

Damon: Well, what do you know?
[Elena and Stefan, startled, turn around to see Damon. Damon's lip curls up in a snarl.]

Damon: This is an interesting turn of events.
Stefan: I can't let you bring her back. I'm sorry.
Damon: So am I. For thinking for even a second that I could trust you.
Stefan: Oh. You're not capable of trust. The fact that you're here means that you read the journal and you were planning on doing this yourself.
Damon: Of course I was going to do it by myself, because the only one I can count on is me! You made sure of that many years ago, Stefan. But you...
[Damon looks back at Elena.]

Damon: You had me fooled.
[Damon looks hurt and Elena looks ashamed.]

Damon: So what are you going to do now? Because if you try and destroy that, I'll rip her heart out.
Stefan: You won't kill her.
[Damon nods, knowing Stefan is right. Instead, he vamp-speeds over to Elena and grabs her in a chokehold.]

Damon: I can do one better.
[Damon bites his wrist and forces Elena to drink his blood. Elena struggles.]

Damon: Give me the book, Stefan, or I'm snapping her neck. And you and I will have a vampire girlfriend.
Stefan: Let her go first.
[Damon pulls his wrist away from Elena's mouth.]

Damon: The book!
Stefan: I'm not going to give this to you until she is standing next to me.
Damon: Problem is, I no longer trust that you'll give it back!
Stefan: You just did the one thing that ensures that I will.
[Damon, still keeping Elena in a chokehold, nods at Stefan.]

Stefan: Okay.
[Stefan, eyes filled with terror, slowly places the book on the ground and reaches out for Elena. Damon places his face against Elena's hair, looking as if he might not let her go, but slowly he pulls his arm away from her. Elena slowly edges to the side of the grave, then quickly jumps over it and into Stefan's arms. Stefan wraps her in a warm embrace. Elena looks at Damon, terrified, and Stefan and her walk out of the woods together. Damon watches them go and picks up the grimoire.]

Mystic Falls 1864
[A group of men walk across Mystic Falls, carrying torches and weapons, Johnathan Gilbert is at the head of the pack with his vampire compass out.]

First man: Make sure the two of you stick together!
Second man: Go and check those woods over there!
[The men continue to talk to each other and bark orders.]

[At the Salvatore House, Giuseppe watches the Sheriff place a muzzle over Katherine. The Sheriff and another man pick Katherine up and start carrying her off. Damon bolts into the room.]

Damon: No! Don't take her!
[Giuseppe grabs Damon and slams him against the wall. Damon struggles to free himself, but the two men carry Katherine out of the room. Katherine looks over at Damon, to weak to do anything.]

Giuseppe: Do you know what they'll do to you if you're branded a sympathizer? You'll be killed along with them!
[Damon grabs his father by the shoulders and looks him dead in the eye.]

Damon: Then let me be killed!
Old Cemetery
[Damon looks down at Giuseppe's grave for a moment longer then runs off with the grimoire in hand.]

Gilbert Residence
[Stefan leans against the doorway in the bathroom as he watches Elena who is searching the drawers for an Aspirin.]

Elena: Aspirin must be downstairs. Is my head supposed to hurt like this?
Stefan: Oh, you'll be fine. That was just a small amount of blood. It should pass out of your system by tomorrow.
[Elena walks towards Stefan. Stefan rubs her back and Elena looks up at him.]

Elena: Are you OK?
Stefan: Damon was right. This is, uh...this is my fault.
Mystic Falls 1864
[Two men carry Katherine to a cart and place her in it. Damon runs toward the cart, Stefan close behind him. Stefan manages to catch up with Damon and thrusts his arm in front of him, stopping Damon.]

Stefan: Damon! Damon! Stop, stop. I'll help you. We'll get her back.
[Damon violently shoves Stefan away.]

Damon: Help me!? Don't you think that you've done enough? You promised you wouldn't tell him!
Stefan: I didn't think this would happen.
[The cart with Katherine in it starts to leave. Damon and Stefan watch as Katherine goes off to her death. Damon looks at Stefan with intense anger.]

Damon: You did this. This is your fault.
[Damon runs off.]

Gilbert Residence
[Stefan's recounting his story to Elena.]

Stefan: I put my faith in my father, but Damon put his faith in me, and I destroyed that. This is my fault.
[Elena caresses Stefan's face.]

Elena: You didn't do anything wrong. Don't forget that.
Stefan: Okay.
[Stefan caresses Elena's face. Elena groans and holds her head.]

Stefan: I'm going to get you that aspirin.
Elena: Okay.
[Stefan kisses Elena's forehead and leaves the room. Elena lies down on her bed. Stefan makes his way downstairs and into the kitchen. Jenna is sitting at the dining room table. Stefan smiles at her.]

Jenna: You know you're not staying the night, right?
[Stefan leans against the doorframe.]

Stefan: We're just going to hang out for a little while.
Jenna: You're lucky I like you. Keep the door open.
Stefan: You got it. Hey, do you have any aspirin?
Jenna: Yeah.
[Jenna gets up and rummages through the cabinets. Jeremy enters the room.]

Jeremy: Oh, hey, Stefan. [He looks around the room.] Where'd she go?
Jenna: She went to the bathroom.
Stefan: Where'd who go?
Jenna: He has a friend over.
Jeremy: Anna.
[Stefan looks as if he finally realizes who Anna is.]

Mystic Falls 1864
[Pearl is watching the chaos unfold around her. Anna walks up to her, looking worried.]

Anna: What's happening?
Pearl: Get Emily. Stay hidden. I'll get us out of here.
[Pearl pushes Anna back and Anna retreats. Stefan is nearby and he watches as Pearl runs across the field towards a horse. She unties the horse's reins from its post. Johnathan jogs up to her.]

Johnathan: Pearl!
Pearl: Johnathan!
Johnathan: Do you see all this? The town's gone mad rounding up the demons.
[Pearl walks towards him. Johnathan smiles up at her. Suddenly,the compass needle starts spinning and points towards Pearl. Johnathan, having heard the needle move, looks down at it and back up at Pearl.]

Johnathan: You!
Pearl: Johnathan...please.
[Johnathan looks at her, completely stunned. Pearl starts to back away. Anna sees this event unfolding and tries to rush to her mother's side, but Emily holds her back.]

Pearl: I beg you!
Johnathan: I've got another one over here!
[Pearl vamp-speeds across the field, but is shot by a random man. Anna screams and tries to run towards Pearl.]

Anna: Mother!
[Emily covers Anna's mouth with her hand.]

Emily: Shh, shh!
[Pearl falls to the ground. Stefan watches this from a distance. Johnathan and the other man runs towards Pearl, muzzling her.]

Man: Johnathan, this way!
[Johnathan and the other man drag a struggling Pearl across the grass towards another carriage.]

Emily: [to Anna] Shh! It'll be all right. You're going to see her again. I already know how to protect them. I'm going to protect them.
[Emily removes her hand from Anna's mouth. Anna continues to cry silently. Stefan looks over at them. Emily nods at Stefan and Anna looks over at him.]

Gilbert Residence
[Stefan runs over to the staircase and when he is out of Jeremy and Jenna's sight, he uses his vamp-speed to cover the remainder of the length to Elena's room.]

Stefan: Elena!
[Stefan looks around the room and sees that Elena's window is wide open and Elena is no where in sight.]

Motel Room
[Elena groggily awakens. She spots Ben sitting in a chair by the end of the bed, sleeping. She gasps and sits up frantically. Elena looks around for a way out and stares at the front door. She looks from Ben to the door, estimating if she can make it without waking him. Quietly, Elena slides off the bed and slowly steps over Ben's outstretched leg. She slowly backs up to the door, keeping an eye on Ben. Elena unlocks the deadbolt on the door, looking back at Ben occasionally. Elena turns the lock on the door and prepares to open it.]

Ben McKittrick: I wouldn't.
[Elena gasps and spins around. Ben inches towards Elena and uses his compulsion on her.]

Ben McKittrick: Don't try to escape. Don't even move. Do you understand?
Elena: I understand.
[Ben scoffs and turns around to get a bottle of blood out of the mini fridge. Elena opens the front door and bolts out, but Anna blocks her escape. Anna grabs Elena by the hair and pushes her back into the motel room.]

Anna: Seriously?!
Ben McKittrick: I told her not to move! I did that eye thing that you taught me!
Anna: And forgot the lesson about vervain! She dates a vampire, Ben. Duh!
[Anna pushes Elena up against a wall and opens the bathroom door.]

Elena: Who are you? What do you want?
Anna: Does it matter?
[Anna forcefully pushes Elena into the bathroom and shuts the door. Elena flips the light switch and calmly searches the room for another exit. Elena looks over towards the bathtub and sees Bonnie lying in it, unconscious. Elena rushes over to her.]

Elena: Bonnie? [Lifts Bonnie's head up] Oh my god!
[TITLE CARD AND OPENING CREDITS]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is in the study, reading through Emily's grimoire. Stefan enters the room with an anxious look on his face. Damon does not look up at him.]

Stefan: Anna took Elena.
Damon: Yeah, I got that from your 600 voice mails.
[Stefan strides across the room towards Damon.]

Stefan: Damon, all night long, every single street in town, I've been searching. What if your blood hasn't passed out of her system?
Damon: Well, then at least you know you'll see her again.
Stefan: Please. [Stefan sits down on the sofa, next to Damon.] What do you know? You were with Anna, you must know where's she living. Just tell me where I can find her.
Damon: [looks up at Stefan] Nope. You can go. Really.
Stefan: You know, all I can remember is hating you. There might have been a time when that was different, but your choices have erased anything good about you. [Damon lays the grimoire down and gives his attention to Stefan.] But see, I also know you have just as much reason to hate me. This all began with me. Katherine got taken away from you because of me. And I'm sorry.
Damon: Apology accepted.
Stefan: So please, just tell me what you know.
Damon: Huh.
Stefan: [pleading] It's Elena, Damon. If you know something, tell me.
[Damon stands up and Stefan mimics him, looking at Damon with anxiety.]

Damon: I mean this sincerely. [Stefan nods, anticipating his answer.] I hope Elena dies.
[Damon walks past Stefan, leaving the room.]

Motel Room
[Elena wets a cloth in the sink and places it on Bonnie's forehead. Bonnie slowly opens her eyes.]

Elena: Bonnie?
Bonnie: Elena?
Elena: Oh, you're okay!
Bonnie: My head...
Elena: Come here.
[Elena pulls Bonnie upright.]

Bonnie: Oh my god! Ben is a-!
Elena: Shhhh.
[Elena gestures at her ear and points toward the door.]

Elena: They can hear.
[Elena gets up and turns on the tap. She kneels back down next to Bonnie.]

Bonnie: I'm so stupid!
Elena: No, he had all of us fooled!
Bonnie: What's going on? Why are we here?
Elena: It must have something to do with the tomb and Emily's spell book.
Bonnie: Spell book?
Elena: Damon said it could be used to open the tomb.
Bonnie: Why didn't I know about any of this?
Elena: I was trying to keep you out of it, hoping it would never come to this.
Bonnie: Come to what?
Elena: They need a witch to break the spell and let the vampires out.
Bonnie: No way!
Elena: I know.
[Ben bursts through the door. Elena grabs Bonnie's shoulders protectively. Ben turns the tap off.]

Bonnie: You're wasting your time. I'm not gonna help you.
[Ben smiles devilishly and grabs Elena. Bonnie reaches out to try to pull her back, but Ben manages to pull Elena away from her.]

Ben McKittrick: That's why she's here. Motivation for you to behave. You know, you shouldn't be so desperate. You made it too easy.
[Ben pushes Elena out of the room, roughly. Bonnie gets up from the tub. Ben shuts the bathroom door.]

Ben McKittrick: She wants to talk to you.
[Elena stumbles into the motel room. Anna leans against a table, looking at Elena.]

Anna: Well, well. Elena Gilbert. You really are Katherine's doppelganger. You must have the Salvatore boys reeling.
Elena: Who are you?
Anna: I'm Anna. Your brother may have mentioned me. [says with girlish sarcasm] I mean, we're like, practically dating.
Mystic Grill
[Jeremy is sitting at a table, doing homework. Nearby, Tyler is shooting pool while Matt cleans a table and talks to Tyler.]

Tyler: Ten kegs? You know how much damage we could do with ten kegs? Duke's got it all hooked up.
Matt: Duke's a douche.
Tyler: Yeah, a douche with ten kegs. Aka, my new best friend.
[Jeremy scoffs.]

Tyler: What's the problem, Gilbert?
Jeremy: Don't have one, Lockwood.
Tyler: Yeah, I didn't think so.
Matt: Do you ever get bored of it?
Tyler: Of what?
Matt: Yourself.
[Matt walks off and Jeremy laughs quietly. Tyler looks at Jeremy.]

Tyler: Keep laughing, buddy.
[Caroline enters the Grill and walks over to Jeremy.]

Caroline: Hey, Jeremy. Where is Elena? I've been texting her and Bonnie all day about Duke's party.
Jeremy: Uh, she went somewhere with Stefan.
Caroline: [sighs] I am so not going to be one of those girls who disappears just because she has a new boyfriend.
Jeremy: Who is Duke?
Caroline: Some guy that graduated a couple of years ago. And he throws a party every time he comes home from Duke.
Jeremy: Wait, Duke goes to Duke?
Caroline: His real name's Bob or something. [Jeremy laughs quietly.] He's a total ass. But he buys the beer. You know, you should come.
Jeremy: Uh, yeah, I - I don't think so.
Caroline: No, seriously. Everyone goes. Even quiet loner little brothers. [Caroline sees Matt.] Think about it.
[Caroline walks up to Matt.]

Caroline: Hey!
Matt: Hey.
Caroline: So, I have a speech. It is fully scripted and well-rehearsed. Are you ready for it?
Matt: You wrote a speech?
Caroline: Yes. It's a You kissed me and I don't want things to be weird speech. It's preemptive.
Matt: [chuckles] Preemptive?
Caroline: Yeah, you know, in case you were having second thoughts or regrets, or were, like, ooged out-
Matt: Ooged, huh?
Caroline: Can I just get on with the speech part?
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Caroline: So I know that you don't think that this is going to work out between us. I just want to let you know that right here and right now, I'm offering you an out. Like an escape clause.
Matt: Why are you giving me an escape clause?
Caroline: I don't wanna make assumptions about what it is we're doing here.
Matt: Got it.
Caroline: So, if you would like to exercise it, just let me know.
Matt: I'm good, but thanks.
Caroline: Okay. Good.
Matt: Yeah.
Caroline: So, see you for Duke's tonight.
Matt: Yeah.
[Matt smiles and gets back to work. Caroline laughs happily.]

Sheila's Residence
[Damon knocks on the front door. Sheila opens it.]

Grams: Yes?
Damon: Hi there. I'm, uh, looking for Bonnie.
Grams: She's not here.
Damon: Oh, well do you know when she-
Grams: Never.
Damon: [chuckles] You have quite an opinion for someone who doesn't know me.
Grams: You got some nerve knocking on a Bennett witch's door and asking her for anything.
Damon: What'd I do?
Grams: Spirits talk, Mr. Salvatore, and so does my granddaughter. You are no friend to us. Now get off my porch.
[Damon takes a step closer to Sheila.]

Damon: Step outside and say that.
[Sheila stares at Damon. Suddenly, Damon groans and holds his head which feels like it's exploding. Damon starts to back and Sheila steps out onto the porch.]

Grams: I am not Bonnie. You don't wanna mess with me.
[Sheila goes back into her house and slams the door shut, breathing heavily as she leans against the front door.]

Motel Room
[Anna peers out the curtain, looking outside.]

Elena: Bonnie's not gonna open the tomb.
Anna: Oh, I think she will.
Elena: Do you really want Katherine out that bad?
[Anna looks over at her.]

Anna: Trust me. No one I know wants to see that girl again. Except Damon, the lovestruck idiot.
Elena: Then what is it? Or who is it?
Anna: My mother's in there. [Anna walks closer towards Elena.] Katherine couldn't help herself. She just had to toy around with both of the Salvatore brothers. And when she got caught, so did my mother. I watched Johnathan Gilbert take her away.
Elena: [sincerely] I'm sorry.
Anna: You really mean that, don't you? [chuckles] Yeah, I think we'll skip the dead mom bonding so you can start serving a purpose.
Elena: Which is what?
Anna: Leverage. This belong to you?
[Anna holds up Elena's phone. Elena tries to grab it from her, but Anna pulls it away.]

Anna: Ah-ah!
[Anna walks across the room, dialing a number on the phone. The phone rings and Stefan picks up from the other end, at the Salvatore House.]

Stefan: Elena? Are you okay?
Anna: She's fine. For now. Tell me you have the grimoire and she'll stay fine.
[Damon enters the room, leaning against the door frame of the study in the Salvatore house.]

Stefan: I can get it.
Anna: Which means your brother has it. And I have the witch. So one of you had better meet me in the very public town square in 30 minutes so we can safely discuss how fun it's gonna be to work together.
[Anna hangs up. Stefan does the same and looks back at Damon.]

Damon: Go ahead. Grovel again. Oh, wait no...I don't care.
[Damon leaves the room.]

[Anna knocks on the bathroom door]

Anna: I'm leaving.
[Ben opens the door to the bathroom and leads Bonnie out.]

Anna: Keep them buttoned down. Compulsion won't work. Just use violence.
Ben McKittrick: Right. I got that.
[Anna leaves. Ben pushes Bonnie onto the bed.]

Ben McKittrick: Sit. Behave. [to Bonnie] So you're the key to this. Literally. The one who opens the door. Tell me, how long have you been a witch?
Elena: Is there anything to drink here?
[Ben gets up and walks over to Elena.]

Ben McKittrick: Are you offering? There's water on the night stand.
[Elena picks up the glass of water and starts to take a drink.]

Bonnie: Hey. Can I have a sip?
[Elena pulls the glass away from her mouth, understanding what Bonnie plans on doing. She hands over the glass. Bonnie takes it and tosses the water on Ben. Bonnie turns the water into flames. Ben yells and pats the flame down on his arm. Elena and Bonnie get up and run to the door. Bonnie makes it to the door and opens it, ready to run out, but Ben grabs Elena before she is able to make it out.]

Ben McKittrick: Come back in! Shut the door!
[Bonnie slides back into the room.]

Bonnie: Don't hurt her!
Ben McKittrick: Don't make me!
[Bonnie shuts the door behind her.]

Ben McKittrick: Lock it!
[Bonnie deadbolts the door.]

Town Square
[Anna is walking through the Town Square. Jeremy sees her from the Grill and runs over to her.]

Jeremy: Anna! Hey-uh, what happened to you last night?
Anna: Sorry, I had to leave. I told your sister to tell you.
Jeremy: I haven't seen her.
Anna: Well, I gotta run, so-
[Anna turns to leave.]

Jeremy: Hey, do you wanna go to a party tonight?
Anna: Go to what?
Jeremy: Oh, the guy who's throwing it is a total douche, but it's supposed to be fun. I figured, you know, safety in numbers.
Anna: [chuckles] So, you're finally ready to go out with me, are you?
Jeremy: It's been a while since I've been to a party, and I kind of want to get back out there. And not be such a - a loner. And, uh, I like you. You're fun, and you're also kind of strange and lurky but, uh, I guess I like that, too. So, yeah, you should come to the party. With me. It's in the woods by that old cemetery.
Anna: Oh. It's there, huh? That sounds cool. Uh, I'll meet you.
Jeremy: Oh. Okay! Great.
[Anna starts to walk away. Jeremy watches her.]

Jeremy: Cool.
Anna: Okay.
[Anna looks glances back at him and Jeremy leaves. Anna sits down on a bench, waiting and looking around. Suddenly, Damon appears next to her, sitting on the bench.]

Damon: Got a hot date or are you just plan on nabbing the entire Gilbert family?
Anna: A party, right next to the old cemetery. Isn't that nice of them? Lots of warm bodies for starving vampires.
Damon: I told you. I work alone.
Anna: Yeah, so do I. But your minus a witch and I'm minus a spell book. So what do you say?
Damon: Stefan will come after you, you know that. For messing with Elena.
Anna: Then he won't be to happy if I kill her when I don't get what I want.
[Anna gets up and starts to walk away. Damon scrunches up his face and sighs.]

Damon: When do you want to do this?
[Anna smiles and turns around, laughing at Damon.]

Anna: God, it's like 1864 all over again. You Salvatores are truly pathetic when it comes to women. Tonight. After sundown. Meet at the church.
[Anna leaves.]

Motel Room
[Elena and Bonnie have resumed their seats on the beds. Ben paces in front of them.]

Ben McKittrick: Witches don't have eternal life, right? So you guys can die.
Bonnie: Yep. We can die.
Ben McKittrick: Ah. That sucks.
[All of a sudden, Stefan kicks the door in. Ben screams as the sunlight starts to burn his skin. Stefan rips the curtain open, allowing more sunlight to pour in. Ben hides in the dark between the two beds.]

Elena: Stefan!
[Bonnie and Elena get up and dash out the door.]

Stefan: Let's get outside!
[Stefan walks over to Ben, looking down at him.]

Stefan: When the sun goes down, leave town. If I ever see you again, I will kill you.
[Stefan leaves.]

Sheila's Residence
[Bonnie and Sheila sit at a table, conversing.]

Bonnie: How did you know where we were?
Grams: Many things can fuel a witches power. Worry. Anger. After Stefan told me they had taken you, I had a lot of both. Simple locater spell was easy after that.
Bonnie: I'm sorry. About all of this.
Grams: [with a smirk] Not as sorry as they're gonna be.
[Stefan and Elena enter the room.]

Elena: So what do we do now?
Stefan: Well, for now, you need to stay here.
Grams: A prisoner, in my own home? I don't think so.
Stefan: I can't protect you if you leave the house.
Grams: We'll protect ourselves.
Elena: We need to let him have Katherine back. He's not going to stop until he gets her. If we help him, maybe that ends it.
Bonnie: No! He doesn't deserve to get what he wants.
Elena: What other choice do we have?
[Elena looks up at Stefan.]

Grams: Witches being pulled down by vampire problems. As much as we tried to do to stay out of it. I'll open the tomb. You get your brother's girl and destroy the rest with fire. Then this will be all over.
Stefan: We still have to get Damon to agree.
Elena: He already agreed once.
Stefan: Yeah, and then we double crossed him. So now he's angry.
Elena: He's hurt. There's a difference. I think I know what I have to do.
[Elena and Stefan exchange looks.]

Motel Room
[Anna walks back up to the motel room. She sees that the door is wide open and Elena and Bonnie have escaped.]

Anna: You've got to be kidding me.
[Anna walks in and looks over at Ben, who is still crouched between the two beds, his hoodie over his head.]

Ben McKittrick: It was Stefan. There was nothing I could --
[Anna holds her finger up at him.]

Anna: Shut up! Stop talking. [She rubs her face with her hands and sits down in a chair.] Without the witch, we don't have Damon or the grimoire. Damon's not gonna stop. He'll find a way in. And we're gonna be there when he does.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon puts on his jacket, preparing to leave. Elena enters the room and removes her scarf. Damon looks up at her.]

Damon: I'm gonna have to change the locks. You stage a jailbreak?
[Damon picks up the grimoire.]

Elena: Stefan.
Damon: Ah, brother. Ever the white knight.
Elena: I convinced Bonnie to help you.
Damon: I doubt that.
[Elena walks around the edge of the study towards the stairs, leading to the sunken part of the room where Damon is.]

Elena: I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry we got the grimoire without you last night, because I'm not really.
Damon: Well, at least you're honest.
Elena: I was protecting the people I love, Damon. But so were you, in your own, twisted way. And as hard as it is to figure, we're all on the same side, after the same thing.
[Elena descends the stairs.]

Damon: Not interested.
[Damon starts to leave.]

Elena: Yes you are, because you were willing to work with us yesterday.
Damon: [turns around] Fool me once, shame on you.
Elena: Okay, when we were in Atlanta, why didn't you use your compulsion on me?
[Damon places the grimoire on a table and walks towards Elena, crossing his arms.]

Damon: Who's to say I didn't?
Elena: You didn't. I know you didn't. But you could have. You and I...we have something. An understanding. And I know that my betrayal hurt you, different from how it is with you and Stefan, but I'm promising you this now, I will help you get Katherine back.
Damon: [groans, unconvinced] I wish I could believe you.
[Elena unclasps her necklace, takes it off, and holds it in her hand, showing it to Damon.]

Elena: Ask me if I'm lying now.
[Elena places the necklace down on a table and waits for Damon to respond.]

Damon: You know Anna won't stop, by the way, no matter what I do.
Elena: Then we'll deal with it.
[Damon picks up Elena's necklace and clasps it back around her neck.]

Damon: I didn't compel you in Atlanta because we were having fun. I wanted it to be real. I'm trusting you. Don't make me regret it.
[Damon walks away.]

The Woods
[Elena and Damon arrive at the party in the woods and see over a dozen students drinking and chatting.]

Elena: The Duke party. I forgot. I hope they stay clear of the church.
Damon: Your hope, not mine.
[Matt and Caroline walk up to them.]

Matt: Elena, hey!
Caroline: Elena! Oh my God, where have you been?
[Caroline intertwines her fingers with Matt's. Elena acknowledges this action.]

Damon: Long story, no time to tell it.
Caroline: I wasn't talking to you.
Damon: Sure you were.
Matt: We haven't met. I'm Matt.
[Matt holds out his hand for Damon to shake.]

Damon: Matt, there's a reason we haven't met. You and I are going that way.
[Damon grabs Elena's arms and starts dragging her away. Elena looks back at Matt and Caroline as she's being pushed along.]

Elena: Ah, I'm sorry, guys.
[Matt and Caroline watch them go.]

[Stefan climbs up from the tomb with a shovel in hand.]

Stefan: Cleared the debris away. Set the torches like you asked. We can get down now.
[Stefan places the shovel against a rock. Cans of gasoline lie near by and Bonnie looks at them.]

Bonnie: What is that?
Stefan: It's everything I need to destroy them.
[Stefan hands Sheila a flashlight.]

Grams: Are you sure that Damon will come back with her?
[Damon whistles. They turn and look at him.]

Damon: Brother. Witches.
[Damon strides past them with the grimoire, Elena trudging along behind him. Damon descends the stairs into the tomb. Elena walks over to Stefan.]

Stefan: Everything okay?
Elena: I just want to get this over with. Are we ready?
Bonnie: I guess so.
[Back at the Duke party, Tyler and another guy are engaging in a beer chugging contest. Tyler wins and slams his cup down on the ground.]

Tyler: Done!
[Jeremy arrives at the party and Tyler spots him.]

Tyler: I'll be right back. [He walks over to Jeremy] Hey man, uh, you got any weed?
Jeremy: Wait, you're kidding me, right? You act like a total dick every time we cross paths, and - and now you wanna party with me?
Tyler: Lighten up, Gilbert. I'm just asking you a question.
Jeremy: Look, I don't get you man.
Tyler: It's a party. You're a partyer. There's no need to psychoanalyze it.
Jeremy: I don't party anymore and even if I did, it wouldn't be with you.
[Tyler starts to walk away.]

Tyler: No problem. Carry on just standing there. By yourself. All alone. The enemy of fun. Do you even have any friends?
[Tyler turns around and walks off. Jeremy turns around and Anna has suddenly appeared behind him. Jeremy is startled, but chuckles.]

Jeremy: Thank God.
Anna: Weird hello but, okay. What's the matter?
Jeremy: Uh, nothing. Nothing, just....
[Anna crosses her arms over her chest and looks at Jeremy, unconvinced.]

Jeremy: It's- nothing.
Anna: Come on, let's walk.
[Jeremy and Anna walk off with their arms around each other.]

Church Ruins
[Sheila is lighting the torches at the tomb. Bonnie stands next to her and Stefan, Damon, and Elena watch from the entrance.]

Grams: Air. Earth. Fire.
Bonnie: Water.
[Bonnie holds up a water bottle and Sheila takes it, sprinkling the water on the floor.]

Elena: That's it? Just water from the tap?
Grams: As opposed to what?
Elena: I just figured maybe it would have to be blessed or mystical or something.
[Sheila smirks at Elena. Damon pulls out a blood bag and unravels it.]

Stefan: What's that?
Damon: It's for Katherine. Gotta have something to get her going. Unless your girl's offering a vein to tap. [He looks back at Elena, who looks at him, unamused. Stefan sighs and Damon whispers his next sentence to him.] Admit it - you can't wait to get rid of me.
Stefan: [chuckles] I can't wait to get rid of you.
Damon: Hmm.
[Bonnie looks up at them from the ground.]

Bonnie: We're ready.
Woods
[Jeremy is leaning against a tree. Anna is standing in front of him.]

Anna: This place is wild.
Jeremy: You kinda like dead people, huh?
Anna: I'm strange, remember? You okay?
Jeremy: Uh, yeah. Yeah. This place makes me think about someone.
Anna: A dead someone?
Jeremy: No, no, just...someone I used to know. So, uh, hey, [chuckles] we made it all of what, 37 minutes, in that party?
Anna: [smiles and laughs] Not your scene?
[Jeremy pushes himself into a standing position.]

Jeremy: I'm not really sure what my scene is anymore. So what do you say? You, uh, you wanna be part of my non-scene?
Anna: I would happily be a part of your non-scene, except, uh, I'm leaving.
Jeremy: Wait, what?
Anna: Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.
Jeremy: Oh. Uh- that's--that's a bummer.
Anna: Yeah?
Jeremy: Well, yeah.
Anna: So, guess this is goodbye.
Jeremy: I guess it is.
[Jeremy and Anna lean into each other and kiss. Anna pulls away, her face transforming. Jeremy looks at her, alarmed.]

Jeremy: Anna, your face!
[Anna turns around]

Anna: It's nothing.
Jeremy: It didn't look like nothing.
[Ben hits Jeremy from behind. Jeremy falls to the ground, unconscious.]

Anna: [sighs] You didn't have to hit him that hard.
Ben McKittrick: Yes, I did.
Anna: Grab him and lets go. I'm taking him to meet my mother.
[Matt is leaning against a tree with a beer in his hand. Tyler sneaks up and swipes the beer out of his hand.]

Tyler: Swoop!
[Tyler takes a drink.]

Matt: Hey!
Tyler: Aah. Where's your date?
Matt: Who knows?
Tyler: Aww, is the honeymoon over already?
Matt: Maybe.
Tyler: After all that grief you gave me about liking her. I figured it would have lasted longer than five minutes.
Matt: Look, I just -- I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing. She -- she seems like she might be a little clingy.
Tyler: Well, good. I need my boy single anyway. [pats Matt's arm.] Ohh, incoming.
[Caroline approaches them with a smile.]

Caroline: Hey! There you are.
Matt: Here I am.
Tyler: Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough. So I'm just gonna go get another beer.
[Tyler walks off.]

Caroline: So...
Matt: So.
Caroline: I have another speech.
Matt: Okay.
Caroline: The hand thing, with Elena, it was lame. Well, I was lame. And, hey, your feelings for Elena aside, Damon was there, and he was always such a jerk to me. And I wanted to show off that I was with a good guy. So, anyway, I was lame. So, forgiven?
Matt: Yeah, of course. Yeah.
[Caroline smiles, relieved.]

Church Ruins
[Bonnie and Sheila are reciting a spell at the tomb, their eyes shut and hands interlocked.]

Damon: What are they saying?
Stefan: Sounds Latin.
Elena: I don't think it's Latin.
[After a few more seconds of the witches reciting the spell, the torches flare up. Elena grabs onto Stefan's arm.]

Elena: What's happening?
[The door to the tomb creaks open. Sheila and Bonnie stop chanting and look up.]

Bonnie: It worked!
Grams: Of course it worked.
Damon: [to Stefan] We have some fires to build.
Stefan: [looks back at Elena, gently touching her shoulder] I'm gonna go get the gasoline, I'll be right back.
[Elena nods and Stefan ascends the stairs out of the tomb. Damon looks from Bonnie and Sheila to Elena.]

Damon: You ready?
Elena: What?
Damon: [to Sheila and Bonnie] You think I'm gonna go in there by myself so you can seal me in?
[Damon grabs Elena.]

Grams: Don't take her in. I'll bring the walls down.
Damon: You'll bring the walls down if I don't. You think I trust you?
Grams: As much as I trust you.
Elena: Enough. Both of you. Look, he needs leverage. He needs to know that you're not going to shut the door when he gets inside. I get it. I'll go.
[Damon grabs a torch from the circle.]

Damon: May I?
[Elena nods at Sheila and Bonnie, reassuringly, and follows Damon into the tomb.]

[Stefan runs over to the gasoline and starts to gather the cans up. Suddenly, someone speaks to him.]

Ben McKittrick: Dark down there?
[Stefan straightens up, looking at Ben. Jeremy, unconscious, lies at Ben's feet.]

Stefan: Thought I told you to leave.
Ben McKittrick: I considered it. Then I thought, screw you.
Anna: Hey, hero. [Stefan turns around and sees Anna] I'm going down there to get my mother.
Stefan: I can't let you do that.
Anna: Well, Ben's about to make a main course out of Elena's little brother. So, you can stop me or him. Your choice.
[Anna vamp-runs into the tomb.]

[Damon and Elena are down in the tomb, searching for Katherine. They hear whispers throughout the tomb.]

Elena: What is that?!
Damon: They can sense you. Now, where is she?
[Damon walks away, leaving Elena behind.]

Elena: Damon!
[Anna descends the stairs into the tomb. Bonnie looks over at her.]

Bonnie: Hey, you're not going in there!
Anna: You think you can stop me?
Grams: Bonnie...
[Bonnie steps aside. Anna grabs a flashlight from the ground and runs into the tomb. Bonnie turns and looks at Sheila, angered.]

Bonnie: Why did you let her go in?
Grams: Because she isn't coming out, baby. None of them are.
[Above the tomb, Stefan and Ben are in a tense conversation.]

Stefan: Do you really think that she cares about you? Hm? You're disposable.
Ben McKittrick: I don't care. She already gave me what I want.
Stefan: Are you going to say eternal life? You really that stupid?
[Ben moves closer towards Stefan.]

Ben McKittrick: You know, I've heard about you. You don't feed. You're not strong enough to beat me.
[Ben rushes at Stefan. Stefan thrusts his arm, easily knocking Ben to the ground. Stefan picks up the hose connected to the gasoline can. Ben gets up and looks at Stefan.]

Ben McKittrick: Is that all you got?
Stefan: No. I got this.
[Stefan ignites the torch and sets Ben on fire. Ben screams and flails around, before finally falling to the the ground, dead.]

[Back in the tomb, Elena is still searching for Damon.]

Elena: Damon? [whispers] Damon!
[Elena continues to hear the whispering around her. Startled, she falls but quickly gets back up. Her flashlight beam lands on one of the mummified vampires. As she walks around the room, she sees more and more vampires. Panicked, Elena  falls down next to one of the mummified vampires, her beam lands on him and she gasps in shock. The vampire's eyes open and are bloodshot with hunger. Elena screams loudly and gets up, looking around for an exit. Her beam of light lands on Anna who is standing right behind her.]

[Stefan walks back down into the tomb and looks around.]

Stefan: Where's Elena?
Bonnie: Damon took her inside.
Stefan: What?!
[Stefan runs towards the entrance of the tomb. Sheila grabs his arm.]

Grams: Stefan! If you go in there, you won't come out.
Stefan: What did you do?
Grams: Opening the door didn't remove the seal, it just opened the door.
Stefan: What's the seal?
Grams: Some seals keep vampires from entering. This one keeps them from coming out.
Stefan: Elena's human. She can leave. Anna and Katherine can't. Damon can't. You were never planning on breaking the spell, were you?
Grams: I told you. I will protect my own. Elena can get out. That's all that matters.
[Anna steps towards Elena, shining her flashlight on her.]

Anna: You must have a taste for it. You scream and shriek and even bother to escape, but then you just come right back to it.
[Elena walks backwards and bumps into Pearl. Anna sees her mother and kneels down next to her, caressing her arm.]

Anna: Mother! Mother. Your boyfriend did this, you know.
Elena: His father did.
[Anna stands up and faces Elena.]

Anna: And Johnathan Gilbert. I made a choice a long time ago that it would be Gilbert blood that brought her back to life. I had Jeremy all ready to go but....
[Elena gasps and turns around, bolting from the room, but Anna vamp-runs in front of her, grabs Elena by the wrist, and bites down. Elena screams loudly.]

[In the ante-chamber, Stefan hears Elena's screams echo through the tomb. Stefan dashes into the tomb. Bonnie chases after him.]

Bonnie: Stefan! [Sheila blocks Bonnie from entering the tomb.] You can't just leave him in there, Grams!
Grams: He made his choice!
Bonnie: No. Here. [She picks up the grimoire and looks desperately at her Grams.] Just show me what to do. I'll do it.
Grams: We are not strong enough. Even if we were able to bring the seal down, there's no guarantee that we could get it back up again.
Bonnie: You said it yourself, many things can fuel a witches power. Help me or I'll do it alone.
[Anna pushes Elena down on the ground, across Pearl's lap, and holds Elena's wrist up to her mouth. Elena struggles, but Pearl, smelling the blood, begins to drink.]

Elena: No, please don't!
Anna: [to Pearl]  I'm gonna get you out.
[Stefan runs in.]

Stefan: Let her go!
[Stefan grabs Anna and pushes her aside.]

Anna: No!
[Stefan grabs Elena and pulls her up, pushing her towards the exit.]

Stefan: Go. Go. I'm right behind you.
[Stefan blocks Anna from chasing down Elena.]

Pearl: Anna.
[Anna rushes to her mother's side, caressing her face in her hands and crying happily.]

Pearl: Annabelle.
[Bonnie and Sheila are looking through the grimoire when Elena exits the tomb.]

Bonnie: Elena, Stefan...
Elena: He's right behind me.
[Bonnie and Sheila look at the entrance to the tomb. Elena turns around and sees Stefan standing in the doorway. Elena walks up to him, worried.]

Elena: Stefan, what are you doing?
Bonnie: It's gonna be okay. We'll fix it.
Elena: What is it?
Stefan: I can't.
Elena: Can't? Can't what?
Bonnie: The spell's still up. We can't get them out yet.
Elena: You went in there not knowing if you could come back out?
[Stefan looks down, not answering.]

Elena: Oh, my God.
Stefan: I heard you scream.
Elena: We can't leave him in there. We promised him. Both of us.
Stefan: I know.
Grams: Even if we're able to break through the seal, we won't be able to hold it for long.
[Stefan goes back into the tomb to find Damon.]

[Damon is still searching the tomb for Katherine. Frustrated, he kicks the dirt on the floor.]

Damon: She's not here.
[Stefan walks up to Damon.]

Stefan: Damon.
Damon: She's not here.
Stefan: What?
[Damon pulls out the blood bag.]

Damon: She's not here!
[Damon throws the blood bag at the wall. The blood splatters across it. Damon looks at Stefan with anguish.]

[Sheila and Bonnie are reciting the spell to lift the seal as Elena circles around them. The torches flare up and Elena looks towards the tomb.]

Elena: I think it's working.
[Anna exits the tomb with Pearl, who is still weak.]

Anna: I just wanted my mother back. Jeremy's fine. He's outside. I won't touch him.
[Anna and Pearl leave. The torches begin to falter.]

Grams: Bonnie, keep going! [to Elena] They better hurry.
Elena: Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!
[The torches extinguish themselves. Bonnie looks faint and Sheila doesn't look much better. Elena runs back into the tomb.]

Stefan: Damon, we need to get out of here.
Damon: It doesn't make sense. They locked her inside.
Stefan: If we don't leave now, we're not getting out.
Damon: How could she not be in here?
Stefan: It's not worth spending all of eternity down here. She's not worth it!
Damon: No!
[Damon angrily pushes Stefan away. Elena rushes into the room.]

Elena: Damon! Please.
[Damon, Stefan, and Elena leave the tomb.]

[Bonnie and Sheila are still chanting the spell to keep the seal down. Bonnie stops for a moment, gasping for air and keeling over.]

Bonnie: Oh my God. I can't!
Grams: Yes, you can.
[They continue chanting. Damon exits the tomb first, followed by Elena, who turns around and embraces Stefan when he exits. The door to the tomb closes and the torches die out.]

[At the party in the woods, Caroline is talking with a group of friends, she looks over at Matt, who is leaning against his truck and they smile at each other. Caroline walks over to him.]

Matt: Is this for real?
Caroline: Is what for real?
Matt: You being all cool and honest and open?
[Caroline walks a step closer to Matt.]

Caroline: Speech number three? I want this to work. And I'm scared that you're gonna change your mind and you're not gonna want it. I don't want to mess it up.
Matt: I don't want to mess it up either.
[They place their foreheads together]

[Stefan and Elena exit the tomb and run over to Jeremy, who is waking up.]

Stefan: He's okay.
[Elena and Stefan kneel down next to Jeremy, who groans.]

Stefan: He's all right.
[Damon exits the tomb, looking completely miserable. Elena gets up and walks towards him. She wraps his arms around him and places her head on his shoulder.]

Elena: I'm sorry.
Sheila's Residence
[Sheila walks unsteadily to her room. Bonnie gently grabs her arms to guide her.]

Bonnie: Hey, let me help you.
Grams: Oh, I'm fine. You don't need to coddle me, baby.
Bonnie: It was a big spell, Grams. I could tell it took a lot out of you.
Grams: I'll be fine.
[Sheila continues to walk unsteadily towards her bed as Bonnie looks on with worry.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena carries a glass of water and an Aspirin into Jeremy's room and hands it to him.]

Elena: How's your head?
Jeremy: Uh- it's alright. I just....I wish I knew how I passed out. I didn't drink that much, I swear.
Elena: And you don't remember anything?
Jeremy: The whole things pretty cloudy. I just...I know how this looks. I'm -- I'm sorry.
Elena: No, Jeremy, don't be sorry. You didn't do anything, okay?
Jeremy: Yeah, okay.
Elena: I've got to head on over to Bonnie's for a little bit, but is there anything that you need?
Jeremy: No, I'm just...I'm gonna crash.
Elena: Okay, well, Jenna's here and I'll be back soon.
[Elena leaves. Jeremy gets up from his bed and goes to his computer. He googles the word Vampire.]

Motel Room
[Pearl and Anna go back to the motel room. Anna turns on the light and gets a shock when she sees Damon sitting in a chair in the corner of the room.]

Damon: You knew Katherine wasn't in there.
Anna: You wouldn't have helped me.
[Damon vamp-runs at Pearl and grabs her by the throat.]

Anna: No! No!
Damon: Why do you get a happy ending?
[Anna rushes towards him.]

Anna: Damon, please! You wouldn't have helped me, you know you wouldn't have!
[Damon grabs a hold of Anna, restricting her movement.]

Damon: Why do you get it and I don't?
Pearl: The guard. The one at the church. The one who locked us in. She promised to turn him. He was obsessed with her. She had him under her spell, like everybody else. He let her go.
[Damon releases Anna and Pearl. Anna wraps her arms around Pearl and looks up at Damon.]

Anna: Last I saw her was Chicago, 1983. She knew where you were Damon. She didn't care.
[Damon is utterly hurt by this new piece of information.]

Anna: Sorry.
[Anna embraces Pearl while Damon leaves the motel room.]

Sheila's Residence
[Elena is at Sheila's house, talking on the phone with Stefan, who is at the Salvatore house.]

Elena: I just got to Bonnie's.
Stefan: Everything alright?
Elena: Yeah. How's Damon? Is he gonna be okay?
Stefan: I don't know. Can I call you later?
Elena: Yeah, of course.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan walks into the parlor. Damon is sitting down, staring blankly at the fire. Stefan sits down next to him. They sit together in silence.]

Sheila's Residence
[Bonnie enters Gram's room carrying a cup of tea for her]

Bonnie: Here you go, Grams.
[Bonnie places the tea on the nightstand and pulls the covers up over Sheila. She looks down at her Grams and gets the feeling that something is wrong.]

Bonnie: Grams?
[Bonnie sits down on the bed and starts to shake Sheila.]

Bonnie: Grams! Grams, wake up! Grams! Grams! [sobbing] Elena!
[Elena dashes into the room, looking bewildered.]

Bonnie: Help! Wake up! She's not breathing! She's just not breathing! Please, wake up!
[Elena runs out of the room and grabs the phone, dialing 911. Bonnie gets up as well.]

Bonnie: I'm gonna fix it! It's okay, I can fix this!
Elena: Yes, I need an ambulance to Oak Street. It's an emergency, quick.
[Bonnie grabs the grimoire and flips through the pages, trying to find a spell to bring her Grams back. Elena walks back into the room and gently grabs Bonnie's shoulders.]

Elena: Bonnie....Bonnie.
Bonnie: No! No! I can fix it! Grams, I can fix this!
Elena: Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie.
[Bonnie continues to sob as Elena wraps her arms around Bonnie, trying to comfort her.]

Church Ruins
[Down in the tomb, the blood bag that Damon threw drips down from the wall. A vampire sits below the pool of blood on the wall and it drips down towards him. The vampire gets up, opens the door of the tomb, and is able to walk out. He looks up at the ceiling, finally free.]

Woods
[A man is backpacking through the woods near the church ruins. He hears the sounds of twigs snapping and turns around, coming face to face with Harper, the vampire from the tomb, who still looks hungry.]

Man: Jeez! You scared me.
Harper: Do you know what day it is?
Man: Saturday.
Harper: And what year?
Man: It's 2010. Are you OK?
Harper: Thank you.
Man: Wait, what's your name?
Harper: It's Harper, sir.
[The man inches closer to Harper, observing him.]

Man: How did you get out here? And why are you dressed like that?
Harper: You seem like a very nice person. I'm sorry.
Man: Sorry for what?
[Harper extends his fangs and bites down on the man's neck. The man screams loudly.]

[TITLE CARD AND OPENING CREDITS]

[Harper has killed the man. He has also taken his clothing. He pats himself down when a cell phone goes off in his pocket. Confused, Harper takes the phone out and throws it down onto the ground. He quickly leaves the woods.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is sitting on the porch swing, her journal laid out on her lap and her phone up to her ear as she leaves Bonnie a voicemail.]

Elena: Hey, Bonnie, it's me just checking in, seeing how you're doing. We miss you here. Don't let your aunt drive you too crazy.
[Jenna walks up onto the porch and stops to look at Elena while sipping her coffee.]

Elena: Come home soon. Love you. [hangs up]
Jenna: What are you doing out here? It's cold.
Elena: Thinking, writing. The, uh, funeral for Bonnie's grandma, it brought back a lot about mom and dad. I was wondering...you said that you would do some digging about them, the adoption.
Jenna: Right.
Elena: So did you? Dig?
Jenna: Come on inside.
[Jenna and Elena go inside. Jenna pulls out her laptop and sits down at the dining table and Elena stands next to her, removing her jacket.]

Jenna: Your dad kept everything from his medical practice, records, logs, old appointment books. [She pulls out a journal and opens it, showing a page to Elena.] I found an entry from the night you were born. Patient and a birth date. Isobel Peterson.
Elena: Do you think that's her real name?
Jenna: Pregnant teenage runaway? Probably not. First name, maybe. But where'd she get Peterson? Classmate? Best friend? So I binged it. [She pulls up the Internet and types in a name in the search engine] I searched for all the Petersons in this area born the same year as Isobel, found 3--2 men and a woman, Trudie, who lived in Grove Hill, Virginia.
Elena: That's not far from here.
Jenna: Well, watch this.
[Jenna types something else into the search engine and pulls up an image of Isobel from high school.]

Elena: Isobel. [looks at the picture with a smile] She was a cheerleader.
Jenna: Trudie still lives there. [She hands Elena a post-it note] This is her address.
Elena: What about Isobel?
Jenna: I couldn't find anything about her. [Elena looks disheartened as she sits down at the table. Jenna briefly pauses before divulging new information] Listen. There's something else. Mr. Saltzman, Ric, his wife was from around here, and her name was also Isobel.
Elena: Wait. Was, as in...
Jenna: She died.
[Later, Elena is putting away clothes in her drawer. Stefan stands behind her as they discuss this new turn of events.]

Stefan: Alaric's wife might have been your mother?
Elena: [sighs] It can't be true, right? I mean, the coincidence alone is just crazy. [She turns around to look at Stefan and holds up the post-it note]  I have the address for her friend Trudie.
Stefan: You wanna talk to her.
Elena: I don't know. I...I--I don't know. If it's true and they are the same person, that means that my birth mother is dead, and I don't know if I could handle that.
Stefan: Elena, did Jenna tell you anything about Alaric's wife? How she died?
Elena: Just that she was killed and the case was never solved.
[Stefan nods at this prior knowledge. Elena looks at him, surprised.

Elena: You knew that already?
Stefan: The night at the school when he attacked me, he told me some things about her death.
Elena: Well, 
Stefan: No, no. [He gently grabs Elena's wrists.] It's not possible. The coincidence is, it's too much. Now, listen, if you do decide to go talk to Isobel's friend, I'll go with you. Okay?
Elena: I just don't know what I'm gonna do yet.
[Elena wraps her arms around Stefan's neck and they embrace each other lovingly.]

Stefan: I should get going. I gotta go deal with Damon.
Elena: How's he doing?
Stefan: He's dealing in his own way.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is feeding off a young sorority girl. There are other girls dancing to the song Black Hearts [On Fire] playing in the room. All of the girls have bite marks up and down their bodies. Damon comes up for air after feeding.]

Girl: How do I taste?
Damon: [drunkenly] Oh, so much better than your friends. But shh. Don't tell them. They might get jealous.
[Suddenly, the lights come on. Stefan enters the room.]

Damon: No! Buzzkill Bob.
[Stefan turns the music off. Damon looks up at him blearily.]

Damon: Greetings.
Stefan: Can we talk?
Damon: Yeah.
Stefan: Without the Tri-Delts.
Damon: Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of them. They're really good at keeping secrets.
[Stefan gets his way though and him and Damon converse in a private corner while the girls lounge around on the sofas. Damon has a bottle of booze in hand.]

Damon: You're worried about me. That's nice. Don't be. There's no need. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? I spent the last 145 years with one goal: get in that tomb. I succeeded. Granted, Katherine wasn't in there to be rescued, but why dwell? You know, it's so liberating not having a master plan, because I can do whatever the hell I want.
Stefan: That's kind of what I'm afraid of.
Damon: Relax. I haven't killed anyone in-- [sighs] too long.
Stefan: Those girls?
Damon: Will end up in their dorm with headaches, think they blacked out. Business as usual. Predictable you didn't pull me over here for a pep talk. So drink up. [He pushes the bottle into Stefan's chest.] Spill it, brother.
[Stefan grabs the bottle and places it to his side.]

Stefan: There was a woman you may have known a few years back named Isobel in North Carolina at Duke.
Damon: You wanna discuss the women in my past right now? Seriously?
Stefan: You killed her.
Damon: What's your point?
Stefan: I just, just wanna know if you remember anything about her.
Damon: Oh, it's like a needle in a haystack, Stefan.
Stefan: Well, think hard. It's important.
[Damon grasps Stefan's shoulder and whispers in his ear.]

Damon: Nothing is important, not anymore.
[He claps Stefan on the shoulder and pulls away, grabbing the bottle from Stefan's hand.]

Damon: Great chat. I have to go and exploit some women in the name of grief, which I'm sure you understand. TTFN, said the Tri-Delt. Heh.
[Damon walks back to the girls.]

Donovan Residence
[Matt and Caroline are on the couch, watching TV. Matt's arm is slung over Caroline's shoulder. Caroline makes a huffing noise. Matt mutes the TV and looks over at her.]

Matt: What?
Caroline: This is boring. I'm bored.
Matt: Wow.
Caroline: But we have this entire house to ourselves. I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad.
Matt: And...
Caroline: So shouldn't we do something a little bit more bachelor-paddy?
Matt: What? Something like this?
[Matt lifts Caroline's chin up and kisses her and pulls away.]

Caroline: Something like that.
[Matt turns away from Caroline, unmuting the TV.]

Matt: I don't know. This is a pretty good show.
[Caroline hits him.]

Caroline: Seriously?
[Caroline crosses her arms and giggles. Matt pushes her down on the couch and she laughs as she wraps her legs around his waist. They begin to kiss passionately. Matt removes his shirt and Caroline removes hers. They continue kissing.]

Kelly: Oh, god.
[Matt looks up suddenly. Kelly is standing in the doorway, looking at them.]

Kelly: Not on my couch.
Matt: Mom! Hey.
[Matt covers Caroline up with a pillow. Caroline places her hands on her face, embarrassed.]

Mystic Grill
[Alaric and Jenna are hanging up a banner, outside, for the Founder's Fundraiser.]

Alaric: I don't know. It's just weird, you know, me being raffled off like a Disney Cruise.
Jenna: In this town, fundraising is like indentured servitude. You don't have a choice. Besides, you're a bachelor, and you're eligible, so there you go.
[Alaric moves to the side of the banner that Jenna is attempting to hang up.]

Alaric: Here. Let me help you with this.
[Alaric helps her hang up the banner and Jenna smiles up at him. Alaric leans in and kisses Jenna. Jenna looks windswept as he pulls away.]

Jenna: Oh, god. I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
Alaric: What?
Jenna: I am totally going to ruin this moment, but I--I have to tell you. Elena recently found out she was adopted, and she's been looking for her birth mother...whose name was Isobel.
Alaric: Isobel? Like my wife?
[Jenna nods.]

Alaric: Isobel never had a baby.
Jenna: Are you sure? Not before you were together?
Alaric: Nope. No way.
[Jenna takes out her phone and hands it to Alaric. A picture of Isobel is on the screen.]

Jenna: This is Elena's birth mother.
[Alaric looks alarmed.]

Alaric: Ah, she, uh, she never told me. I, uh, I'm gonna go. Yeah, I'm gonna, gonna go.
[Alaric awkwardly walks off. Jenna sighs heavily.]

Trudie's Residence
[Elena holds up the Post-It note with Trudie's address and then looks up at the house which matches the address. Elena walks up to the front door and prepares to knock, but hesitates for a moment. Finally, she works up the courage, and knocks on the door. Elena shakes her head and turns away when Trudie answers the door. Elena looks at her.]

Elena: Trudie? Tru-trudie Peterson?
Trudie: Yes?
Elena: Uh, my name is Elena Gilbert. I wanted to talk to you about Isobel Flemming.
Trudie: Well, I haven't heard that name in years. How do you know her?
Elena: I think that, um, well...do you know if she had a baby that she gave up for adoption?
Trudie: My god. You're her daughter. [laughs] I was just gonna make some tea. Would you like some?
Elena: Sure.
Trudie: Uh, the kitchen's this way.
[Trudie backs away from the door, anticipating Elena's entrance. Elena steps over the threshold and Trudie releases her breath, shutting the front door with a quick nervous glance outside.]

[Elena removes her jacket. Trudie walks into the room from the kitchen.]

Elena: I wasn't gonna come. I didn't think I was, but I was driving, and I hit this stoplight, and it made me think about when I was learning how to drive and then my mom would always warn me about this blind turn on the left-hand side, and then I was thinking about my mom, and, I had your address. I'm sorry for barging in.
Trudie: It's no problem. Um, just a surprise, though.
[Elena and Trudie sit down at the table.]

Trudie: I haven't thought about Isobel in years.
Elena: When was the last time you saw her?
Trudie: About 17 years ago, when she left to go have you. We kept in touch for a while, but, well, you know, people drift apart.
Elena: And you don't know where she ended up?
Trudie: She was in Florida for a while. She was on her own. I know it wasn't easy.
Elena: Do you have any idea who my father is?
Trudie: I could never get her to fess up. Anyway, she finally pulled it together, got into college on a scholarship.
Elena: Where did she go?
Trudie: Somewhere in North Carolina. Duke, I think.Smart girl, smart school.
[The kettle starts whistling from the kitchen.]

Trudie: Let me just grab that.
[Trudie gets up and goes into the kitchen, looking back at Elena. She takes her phone out of her pocket and texts She's here. to an unknown number.]

Donovan Residence
[Matt is making breakfast and talking to his mother.]

Matt: So, it's been a few months. Where've you been?
Kelly: Ah, you know, here and there. Never one place too long. You know Pete.
Matt: No, actually, I don't. Because you never brought him around.
[Kelly doesn't respond to the question and walks back over towards Matt, changing the topic.]

Kelly: So blonde's the new flavor of the month, huh? So sorry I scared her off.
Matt: She's not a flavor, Mom. I like her.
Kelly: So she's the one?
Matt: No, probably not, but maybe.
[Kelly grabs a clean glass from the sink and opens the fridge, grabbing a bottle of vodka, before sitting down at the table.]

Kelly: Mattie, seriously, Lezzie Forbes' daughter? Eck.
Matt: Mom, seriously, knock it off.
Kelly: Ice, please?
[Kelly holds her glass out and Matt takes it, opening the fridge and placing ice in it.]

Matt: So, uh, you heard from Vic?
[Matt hands Kelly the glass and she pours some vodka in it.]

Kelly: No, but don't worry. She'll come home eventually when she needs something. I played that game.
Matt: Are you playing it now?
Kelly: No.
Matt: Then what are you doin' home?
Kelly: Are you trying to say I need a reason to come back? Sit down. Eat with me.
[Matt grabs his breakfast off the stove and sits across the table from Kelly.]

Kelly: Tell me everything I've missed, hmm.
Town Square
[Stefan mills around in the Town Square. Alaric walks up to him.]

Alaric: Thanks for meeting me. Something's come up.
Stefan: Jenna told you.
Alaric: Yeah.
Stefan: So it's true. Your wife Isobel was Elena's birth mother.
Alaric: What does Elena know?
Stefan: [sighs, crosses his arms over his chest] About your wife?
Alaric: About everything. About you, your brother.
Stefan: She knows what I am, and she knows that you know about the vampires.
Alaric: Does she know about Damon and Isobel?
Stefan: No. I couldn't tell her, not until I was sure.
Alaric: You said you'd help me.
Stefan: I asked Damon without saying too much. He doesn't remember.
Alaric: Ask him again.
Stefan: Damon is not stable right now.
Alaric: You know, he murdered my wife, or at the very least made a meal out of her. When has he been stable?
Stefan: I'm telling you not to push this.
Alaric: Give me a reason not to.
Stefan: Your survival. How's that for a reason? I'll handle it, but for now, I need you to let it go.
Alaric: Is that what you'll tell Elena? Let it go?
[Stefan moves closer to Alaric until they are merely inches apart.]

Stefan: [threateningly] Leave Elena out of this.
Alaric: I need to know what happened. I think you would, too.
[Stefan breathes out and backs away a bit.]

Stefan: I need something more than just your wife's name. A picture, something I could show Damon.
[Alaric retrieves a photo of Isobel from his wallet and hands it to Stefan. Stefan takes it and walks away.]

Flashback
[In Alaric and Isobel's apartment, Alaric awakens to the sound of typing on a keyboard. He sits up groggily. Isobel is typing away on her computer.]

Alaric: Is.
Isobel: Just a few more minutes.
Alaric: Can't you, uh, can't you finish this in the morning?
[Isobel turns back and looks at him.]

Isobel: But I like working at night.
Alaric: Yeah, see, I like sleeping at night. With you.
[Isobel turns back to her computer and continues typing. Alaric sits up in the bed.]

Alaric: Okay, I'll bite. What is it, thesis stuff?
[Isobel stops typing and bites her lip, not responding.]

Alaric: Look, baby, I'm in a three-way here with you and your computer, the least you can do is let me know what you're up to.
[Isobel gets up from her desk and walks over to the bed.]

Isobel: I was doing research, and I dug up all this stuff about this small town in Virginia near where I grew up. It's isolated, out of the way, and quiet. And every now and then, people die mysteriously, and they say that it's animal attacks. Except, these bodies are drained of blood.
[She pauses briefly. Alaric looks at her, confused.]

Isobel: It's vampires. It has to be.
Alaric: Okay. I'll get my garlic and holy water, and then maybe, just maybe...
[Isobel rolls her eyes.]

Isobel: No.
[Isobel hits Alaric with a pillow.]

Alaric: We can get some sleep. Come here.
Isobel: No.
[Alaric pulls Isobel onto the bed and caresses her face.]

Alaric: Look, this is why I love you, because you believe in all of this stuff. So much so that you're making a degree out of it. You're like Mulder, except hotter and a girl.
[Isobel rolls her eyes again and pushes Alaric down on the bed, moving on top of him.]

Isobel: This is not a joke, Ric. You think that this is cute, but I'm gonna prove it.
[Isobel kisses him then scoots off the bed, heading back to her computer.]

Isobel: And Mulder was right in the end.
Trudie's Residence
[Elena and Trudie are looking through an old yearbook. Trudie points out a picture of her and Isobel.]

Trudie: Ah. They came to the games for us.The football team hadn't won in years. We were the stars. Well, Izzie was. But I was a damn good backup.
Elena: [smiles] Heh. This is great. Thank you.
Trudie: You're welcome. [She looks at Elena's teacup] You haven't touched your tea.
Elena: Oh. Yeah.
[Elena picks the cup up and takes a sip. She furrows her brow at the taste of it and gives it a whiff.]

Elena: What is this?
Trudie: Oh, it's just some herbal mixture.
Elena: Vervain?
[Trudie doesn't respond.]

Elena: You know.
Trudie: Know what?
Elena: You didn't invite me in, and you're serving vervain tea. You know.
[Trudie stands up.]

Trudie: I think that you should probably leave.
[Elena places her cup down.]

Elena: Wait. What are you not telling me?
Trudie: Please leave. Now!
[Elena gets up and leaves the house. As she walks back to her car, grabbing her keys from her purse, she sees a man standing in the middle of the road. As fast as she can, Elena unlocks the car door, ignites the engine and drives off. The man slowly walks down the street towards where Elena was parked.]

Mystic Grill
[Alaric is sitting at the bar, drinking a glass of bourbon. Damon walks up to the bar and stands next to him.]

Damon: Bourbon.
[Damon sits down beside Alaric. The bartender pours bourbon into a glass and pushes it towards Damon.]

Damon: Behold the teacher. Don't you have some papers to grade?
Alaric: It's, uh, more fun with a buzz.
Damon: Well, most things in life are. Sober's depressing.
Alaric: You don't strike me as somebody who gets depressed.
Damon: You say that like you know me.
Alaric: Nope. Just a hunch.
[Damon and Alaric exchange long looks. Alaric finishes his drink and places it down on the bar.]

Alaric: You have a good afternoon.
Damon: Not likely.
[Alaric gets up and leaves. Not long after his departure, Liz walks up to the bar, standing next to Damon.]

Sheriff Forbes: Daytime drinking, huh?
Damon: It's all the rage.
Sheriff Forbes: Listen, I need a favor.
Damon: You ever been in love?
Sheriff Forbes: Excuse me?
Damon: Have you ever been so bent on someone, just to have your heart ripped out by them?
Sheriff Forbes: You forget I was married.
Damon: Right. Gay husband. [He gestures to the barman] She'll have what I'm having.
[The bartender pours another bourbon.]

Damon: [pats the seat next to him] Sit down.
[Liz takes a seat next to Damon.]

Sheriff Forbes: There's a fundraiser here tonight that the Founder's Council is throwing. The town's most eligible bachelors get raffled off for dates, and, well, we're short a bachelor.
Damon: Is this what you do when there's no, um...[lowers his voice] Vampires? Organize bachelor raffles?
[Liz laughs.]

Sheriff Forbes: Oh, trust me. At this point, I miss the vampires. Look, you're a hero to this town, Damon. I know most people don't know it, but you are, and you're single and a catch. Oh, come on, help me out. Carol Lockwood won't let me live it down if I come up empty-handed.
Damon: You know, a room full of women clamoring to win a date with me. Sounds tasty.
Sheriff Forbes: [laughs, relieved] Thank you.
Damon: One thing. Can you get information on someone for me? Alaric Saltzman, the history teacher. There's just something a little off about him, and I just -- I just wanna make sure that the high school did their homework on this guy.
[Liz gets up.]

Sheriff Forbes: You got it.
Damon: Thanks.
[Liz departs as Damon takes a swig from his glass of bourbon.]

Trudie's Residence
[The doorbell rings and Trudie answers the door. The man from the middle of the road is on her front porch.]

Trudie: May I help you?
Man: Thank you for the text.
[Trudie looks surprised.]

Trudie: You're welcome. I didn't tell her anything. I--I kept my promise.
Man: Good.
Trudie: The girl, though, she, she knew something.
Man: That won't be a problem. She won't get any closer to the truth.
Trudie: Good. So I'm done?
Man: Yes. You're done.
[Trudie starts to close the door, but the man grabs a hold of it and starts pushing it back. Trudie struggles to shut it.]

Trudie: No, I won't invite you in! You can't come in!
Man: I'm not a vampire, so, yes, I can.
[The man flings the door open, forcefully, causing Trudie to land on the stairs. He enters the house.]

Trudie: I don't understand. I did what you told me. I did my part!
Man: And now I have to do mine.
[Trudie yells and starts running up the stairs. The man pursues her and grabs her by her hair. He throws her down the stairs and she tumbles to the bottom floor. A pool of blood forms around Trudie's head, indicating that she is dead. The man descends the stairs and steps over Trudie's body, leaving the house.]

Town Square
[Harper walks into the middle of the square and looks around, overwhelmed by the changes over the past century and a half. He looks over at a bench where a woman sits. The woman and him exchange long looks, as if they know each other. She nods her head slightly and Harper walks away.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena enters Stefan's room.]

Elena: Stefan.
Damon: Better. Me.
[Damon walks out of the bathroom, without a shirt on.]

Elena: You look, um...
Damon: Dashing? Gorgeous? Irresistible?
[Damon walks across the room, closing the space between him and Elena. Elena pushes him back when he gets uncomfortably close.]

Elena: Wrecked. You look wrecked.
Damon: No reason why. Do you know that I am one of Mystic Falls' most eligible bachelors?
Elena: Huh.
Damon: Yep.
Elena: How are you doing?
Damon: Never better. Yep.
[He puts on a button up shirt.]

Damon: What can I do for you? I'm a barrel of favors today. It's my newfound purpose, how can I help people?
Elena: I'm just meeting Stefan. We're going to the fundraiser.
[Damon pretends that he is to drunk to button up his shirt, so he tries to het Elena to do it for him so she'll be close to him. He turns around, looking at Elena hoping she'll come over to him.]

Damon: Help a guy out, will you? Can't get this.
[Elena sighs and walks over to Damon. She grabs the front of his shirt and begins buttoning it up.]

Elena: So I found out who my birth mother is.
Damon: Eccch. Who cares?
[Elena looks at him, hurt.]

Damon: She left you. She sucks.
[Elena and Damon exchange glances for a moment, then Elena looks over Damon's shoulder and smiles.]

Elena: Stefan. There you are.
[Elena walks over to Stefan. Stefan smiles at her. Damon starts to put his jacket on.]

Damon: Uhh. I need a bigger jacket. Wow. You know, an occasional sorority girl might, um, you know, help fill you out a little bit.
[Damon throws the jacket onto Stefan's bed and leaves the room.]

Elena: He's fine.
Stefan: He's Damon.
Elena: Maybe this heartache will be good for him. It'll remind him that he has one, even if it doesn't beat.
Stefan: Won't hold my breath.
[Elena smiles and laughs.]

Elena: So I went to see Trudie Peterson.
[Stefan's face becomes stony.]

Elena: I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.
Stefan: How was it?
Elena: She has vervain. She knows about vampire stuff, and it can't be a coincidence.
Stefan: It isn't. This is Alaric's wife.
[Stefan takes out the picture of Isobel that Alaric gave to him and hands it to Elena. Elena looks at it.]

Elena: This is her. This is Isobel. He gave this to you?
Stefan: Everything he knows about vampires, he learned from her. He believes that she was killed by one.
Elena: Oh, my god.
Stefan: Listen, Elena, there's a lot about Isobel that Alaric can tell you, but I need you to hold off a little while before you talk to him.
Elena: Why?
Stefan: I know that it's a lot to ask of you, but will you do that for me?
[Elena nods.]

Mystic Grill
[Carol is on the stage, talking into a microphone, introducing the Fundraiser.]

Mrs Lockwood: Tickets for the raffle are now on sale. All proceeds benefit the annual Founder's Day celebration.
[Jenna walks up to Alaric. Alaric has a drink in his hand.]

Jenna: That's a good look for you.
Alaric: What? Embarrassed and uncomfortable?
Jenna: Yep. That's-- that's the one.
Alaric: Hey, look, um, I'm, uh, sorry about earlier. It was just kind of a--a shock.
Jenna: No, I'm sorry for dropping it on you, but I felt like you should know.
Alaric: No, I get it.
Jenna: At some point, maybe you and Elena could talk. I'm sure she'd like to hear about Isobel, what she was like.
Alaric: Yeah.
Jenna: Uh...Or not. No pressure.
Alaric: I don't know if that's a--a great idea. [clears throat] At least not, not for a while.
[Jenna nods, understandingly.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan walks downstairs where Damon is putting on a bigger jacket.]

Damon: Where'd our girlfriend go?
Stefan: She's on her way to the Grill. I, uh, wanted to talk to you.
[Stefan pulls out the picture of Isobel and hands it to Damon, who looks at it with his usual smugness.]

Stefan: This is the woman, Isobel, from North Carolina. Remember her now?
Damon: Who wants to know?
Stefan: I do.
Damon: Who else wants to know?
Stefan: Did you kill her?
Damon: Sorry. Don't know her.
[Damon walks past Stefan and looks back at him.]

Damon: Hey, are you coming? The Real Housewives of Mystic Falls await.
Mystic Grill
[Caroline, Elena, and Matt are all milling around at the front of the Grill.]

Caroline: He's already been hit on, like, 35 times. He's total cougar bait.
Elena: Impressive.
Matt: More like embarrassing
[Caroline laughs and sees Kelly enter the Grill.]

Caroline: Hi, Mrs. Donovan.
[Kelly glances at Caroline with distaste and looks at Elena.]

Kelly: Elena, honey.
Elena: Hi, Kelly.
[Kelly and Elena exchange hugs.]

Kelly: Long time, no see.
Elena: How are you doing?
Kelly: Oh, same old. Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.
Matt: Mom.
Kelly: Just kidding. Calm down. He found his rebound girl.
[She glances over at Caroline]

Kelly: Oh. Here you go, sweetheart. However many that'll buy.
[Kelly extracts some money and hands it to Caroline, who takes it with a small smile.]

Kelly: I just hope I don't get Bachelor 3. I dated him in high school. Not impressive. [whispers] In any way.
[Matt shakes his head, embarrassed. Caroline hands Kelly her tickets and she takes them.]

Kelly: Very exciting.
[Kelly walks off into the Grill. Elena turns around and sees Alaric. They stare at each other for a moment before Alaric walks off and Elena turns back around with a dissatisfied look.]

[Damon and Carol are talking in another part of the Grill.]

Damon: I've got the big date planned. It's a romantic dinner, secluded spot somewhere woodsy.
Mrs Lockwood: You're making me think I should buy a ticket.
Damon: Well, you are in charge. You could always rig it.
[Damon says this with a sly smirk. Liz enters the Grill and Damon spots her.]

Damon: Mmm. Pardon me.
[Damon rubs Carol's arm and walks over to Liz. Liz and Damon retreat into a corner. Liz has a folder in her hand.]

Sheriff Forbes: I ran the check on the history teacher. You want this before or after your big debut?
Damon: How's it look?
[Liz hands Damon the folder and he begins looking through it.]

Sheriff Forbes: He checks out. Couple of speeding tickets. It's a rough story, though. Turns out his wife went missing a few years back in North Carolina.
Damon: North Carolina? She have a name?
Sheriff Forbes: Yeah. Isobel.
[Liz flips back to a page containing Isobel's photo. Damon looks at it.]

Damon: Isobel.
[Damon looks out into the Grill at Alaric with a very Damon-ish look on his face.]

[Stefan enters the Grill as Carol introduces each of the bachelors on stage.]

Mrs Lockwood: And what do you do, Bachelor Number 3?
Man: Yeah, I'm a plumber.
Mrs Lockwood: Well, isn't that wonderful? We could always use more plumbers. Moving on. Number 4, Alaric Saltzman. Wow. That's quite a mouthful. What do you do, Alaric?
Alaric: I'm a teacher at Mystic Falls High.
Mrs Lockwood: Oh, beauty and brains, ladies. This one's a keeper. What do you teach?
Alaric: History.
Mrs Lockwood: History. Oh, well, give us a fun fact about Mystic Falls, something crazy.
[Alaric looks over at Damon. Damon places his hand up to his ear, sarcastically anticipating a response.]

Alaric: Uh, well...
[Carol pulls the microphone away.]

Mrs Lockwood: He's probably saving the best stories for his date. [She moves down the line] And last, but not least, Damon Salvatore. We don't have much on you.
[Stefan stops in the middle of the room and looks at Elena. Elena smiles at him and waves from a table she is sharing with Jenna. Stefan smiles back and waves, then looks back at the stage.]

Damon: Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.
Mrs Lockwood: Do you have any hobbies, like to travel?
Damon: Oh, yeah. L.A., New York. Couple of years ago, I was in North Carolina. Near the Duke campus, actually. I think, I think Alaric went to school there. Didn't you, Ric?
[Damon turns to look at Alaric, who does the same.]

Damon: Yeah, 'cause I-- I know your wife did.
[Stefan becomes alert and looks over at Elena. Elena's face starts to falter. Stefan makes his way over to her.]

Damon: I had a drink with her once. She was, she was a great girl. I ever tell you that? Cause she was -- Delicious. Mmm! Mmm mmm mmm.
[Elena's mouth hangs open. Her eyes filled with tears as she stares at Damon. Jenna looks over at her.]

Jenna: Are you okay?
Elena: I just need some air.
[Elena gets up and walks past Stefan, out of the Grill. Stefan follows her.]

[Outside, Elena paces around. Stefan exits the Grill and approaches her. She turns to face him.]

Stefan: Elena.
Elena: He killed her? Damon was the vampire that killed her?
Stefan: I don't know what happened. Alaric said that they never found the body.
Elena: Oh, my god. Stefan.
Stefan: I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But I just, I wanted to know more.
Elena: I was feeling sorry for him, hoping that this whole Katherine thing would change him. I'm so stupid.
Stefan: He doesn't know about the connection to you. I thought about confronting him, but he's already so on edge.
Elena: Why are you protecting him?
Stefan: Because you're not the only one hoping that he might actually change.
[Elena shakes her head slightly as her and Stefan look at each other. Elena looks over Stefan's shoulder and back up at him, but does a double take when she recognizes the man from earlier down the street.]

Elena: That man.
[Stefan turns around and looks at the man, who watches them.]

Elena: I saw that man outside of Trudie's.
Stefan: Get back inside. Come on.
[Stefan gently pushes Elena back inside the Grill and follows her soon thereafter.]

[Inside the Grill, Carol pulls out a raffle ticket from the bowl.]

Mrs Lockwood: And bachelor number 3 goes to 37458.
Kelly: That's me.
[Kelly walks towards Carol.]

Mrs Lockwood: Ah. Kelly Donovan. Lovely.
[Kelly takes the ticket from Carol.]

Mrs Lockwood: You and the plumber should have so much fun.
[Kelly walks over to Caroline to claim her prize.]

Caroline: Congratulations, Mrs. Donovan.
Kelly: Okay, just stop. Stop trying so hard. This thing you're doing, this nice thing, it's fake. Like you. Like your mom. And for some reason, Matt fell for it, but that doesn't mean that I will. I don't like you, okay? So tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar.
Caroline: Okay.
[Kelly walks off. Caroline looks hurt by Kelly's presumptions.]

[Elena walks back into the Grill, still upset and shocked. As she continues walking and not paying attention to where she's going, she runs right into Damon.]

Damon: Whoa. Easy there. Buy a ticket like everyone else.
Elena: Did you enjoy that? Rubbing it in to Alaric Saltzman?
Damon: What?
Elena: Just as I was starting to think that there was something redeemable about you.
[Stefan walks up to Elena and Damon.]

Stefan: Elena.
[Stefan shakes his head at Elena. Damon looks from Stefan to Elena.]

Damon: Am I missing something here?
Elena: Did I forget to mention earlier when we were talking about my birth mother? The one that gave me up?
Damon: Mm-hm.
Elena: Her name was Isobel.
[Damon's face falters.]

Elena: Go ahead. Reminisce about how you killed her.
[Elena rams into Damon's shoulder as she walks past him. Stefan and Damon exchange looks and Stefan leaves to follow Elena.]

[Outside, Elena has left the Grill and Stefan follows behind her.]

Stefan: Come on. Let's get you home.
[Elena stops abruptly when she sees the man from earlier standing in front of her. Stefan sees him too and stands slightly in front of Elena, placing his hand out to protect her.]

Man: I have a message for you.
Elena: What?
Stefan: Who are you?
Man: Stop looking.
Elena: Stop looking for what?
Man: She doesn't want to know you. She doesn't want to talk to you.
Elena: Isobel?
Man: You need to stop looking. Do you understand?
Elena: She's alive? Does that mean she's a--
[Elena starts to inch forward, but Stefan puts his arm back to keep her behind him.]

Stefan: Elena, he's under compulsion.
Man: Do you understand?
Elena: Yes. I do.
Man: Good.
[The man looks down the street.]

Man: I'm done now.
[The man steps backwards into the road. A large truck blares its horn but runs over the man, killing him. Elena, shocked, grabs Stefan.]

[Only a moment after the incident, Stefan and Elena run into the middle of the street. People around them are yelling. Stefan kneels down and looks at the man. Elena sees a phone that must have fallen out of the man's pocket and picks it up. Stefan quickly stands up and grabs Elena's arm.]

Stefan: Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on.
[Elena places the phone in her pocket as Stefan drags her off to her car.]

[Inside, Carol holds up another ticket and reads the number.]

Mrs Lockwood: 37649.
[Many of the women in the crowd make disappointed sounds. Jenna raises her hand.]

Jenna: That's me.
Mrs Lockwood: Congratulations.
[Jenna walks up to Carol and takes her ticket.]

Mrs Lockwood: And Bachelor Number 5, Damon Salvatore. [She pulls out a ticket] 37552.
[Alaric walks over to Jenna who hands her ticket to Caroline.]

Mrs Lockwood: Would you look at that? 37552. What are the chances? Me. [She looks around for Damon] Where'd he go?
Alaric: [to Jenna] I'll call you later.
[Alaric starts to leave the Grill.]

Flashback
[In Alaric's and Isobel's apartment, Alaric is sitting on the edge of the bed as Isobel talks to him and paces across the floor.]

Alaric: I think it's time to let this vampire crap go. I mean, the research, the trips, it's become an obsession.
Isobel: Well, this is important to me, Ric.
Alaric: Why? Why is it so important? Explain it to me. I mean, make me understand.
[Isobel doesn't respond.]

Alaric: [sighs] I mean, what's the point of this? You don't want kids. You're barely ever home. I just want us to be normal people.
Isobel: Maybe I don't want to. Maybe I want more.
Donovan Residence
[Matt guides Kelly into the house. Kelly is obviously intoxicated.]

Matt: Here we go. Home, sweet home.
Kelly: Wait. Why, why are we back here? I wasn't ready to leave.
Matt: Yeah, you were, mom.
[Kelly sits down on the sofa with Matt's help and he sits down beside her.]

Kelly: You're the best, Matty.
Matt: I know.
Kelly: I'm--I'm sorry...I was gone so long.
Matt: Why are you really home, mom?
Kelly: It's Pete. He's gone, and it's all my fault. I did it. I always do it.
Matt: No, you didn't, mom. It's not your fault.
Kelly: You're all I have left. [thickly said] Please don't leave me.
Matt: I'm not going anywhere.
[Kelly touches Matt's face and smiles. She then lays her head on a throw pillow and Matt covers her with a blanket.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon walks across the parlor and prepares to make a drink. Quietly, Alaric enters the room with a stake in his hand.]

Damon: Are you really this stupid?
[Damon finishes pouring his drink and turns around to look at Alaric who is standing behind him.]

Damon: Guess so.
[Damon takes a drink, places his glass down, and vamp-runs at Alaric, throwing him across the room. Alaric lands on the floor, heavily, but quickly gets back up, ready to attack.]

Damon: You gonna put down the stake?
[Alaric remains in an attacking stance.]

Damon: Wow. That's courage.
[Damon walks towards Alaric.]

Alaric: Where's Isobel? What have you done to my wife?
Damon: You want me to tell you I killed her? Would that make you happy? Because I think you know what happened.
Alaric: I saw you feeding on her.
Damon: Yeah, I did, and I wasn't lying. She was delicious.
[Alaric rushes at Damon. Damon hits Alaric in the stomach and Alaric keels over falling back onto the floor.]

Damon: Oh, come on. What do you think happened? Not an inkling? Never considered the possibility?
[Alaric looks up at him.]

Damon: I turned her.
Alaric: Why?
Damon: She came to me. All pathetic, looking for vampires. There was something about her, something I liked. There was something special.
Alaric: You turned her because you liked her?
Damon: No, I slept with her because I liked her. I turned her because she begged me to. Yeah. But you knew that, too, didn't you? Hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home, wasn't happy with life in general, wasn't happy with you.
[Alaric rushes at Damon again, but Damon grabs the stake from Alaric's hands and stabs him in the chest, puncturing his lung. Alaric yells in pain.]

Damon: Ah, this is a shame. We're kindred spirits, abandoned by the women we love. Unrequited love sucks.
[Damon removes the stake from Alaric's chest. Alaric wheezes.]

Damon: Sounds like I got a lung. Which means I get to sit here and watch you die.
[Damon tosses Alaric to the floor. Alaric gasps for air and places his hands over his wound. Damon throws the stake down, grabs his drink, and sits down on the sofa as he watches Alaric take one last breath before he dies.]

[Damon takes a swig from his glass as he looks at Alaric's dead body. Stefan walks in the room and looks at Alaric. He rushes over to the body and kneels down next to it, checking for a pulse.]

Stefan: What happened? What did you do?
Damon: Do what? He attacked me.
[Stefan sits up and looks at Damon.]

Stefan: Damon.
Damon: All I did was tell him the truth. His wife didn't want him anymore. It's not my fault he couldn't handle it.
Stefan: Like you've been handling Katherine?
Damon: I'm handling it fine. You know what? Isobel came to me. She found me. And if she's related to Elena, that means she's related to Katherine. Maybe Katherine sent her to me.
Stefan: Stop it. You don't have to keep looking.
Damon: Can't be a coincidence Isobel sought me out. Uh-uh. Can't. [points to Alaric] I'm assuming you'll take care of this.
[Damon gets up and leaves the room. Stefan, exhausted by Damon's actions, sits down next to Alaric's body. Suddenly, Stefan sees Alaric's fingers move. He furrows his brow and leans over Alaric. Suddenly, Alaric gasps back to life, panting heavily. He sits up, confused.]

Alaric: What happened? What's going on?
Stefan: You were just...Did Damon turn you?
Alaric: No. I - I went for him and then he, uh-- he stabbed me.
Stefan: No, no, no. You must have vampire blood in your system. Somebody slipped it to you.
Alaric: [flexes his fingers] No. It's, uh, it's something else.
Stefan: Then how?
Alaric: I, uh...
[Alaric looks down at the ring on his right hand.]

Alaric: Isobel.
Flashback
[Alaric and Isobel are in bed in their apartment. Alaric holds a small box in his hand.]

Alaric: Surprise gifts aren't fair. I always feel bad for not getting you something.
Isobel: Just open it.
[Alaric opens the box and laughs.]

Alaric: Oh, that's a giant piece of jewelry.
[He takes the ring out and examines it.]

Isobel: I know. It's ridiculous. Just tell people it's a family heirloom. Nobody questions that.
Alaric: Where'd you get this?
Isobel: If I told you, you'd laugh at me. But promise me that you'll always wear it. It'll protect you from all the things that go bump in the night.
Alaric: A ring to ward off the demons, eh?
Isobel: Consider it a-- a token of my love, my affection, and if nothing else, an apology for being so crazy.
Alaric: Well, you were definitely crazy.
[Alaric places the ring on his finger.]

Isobel: I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed, and I'm a horrible wife. But you love me anyway.
Alaric: Yes, I do.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Alaric continues to fidget with the ring and looks up at Stefan.]

Alaric: This ring protected me.
Stefan: That's impossible.
Alaric: I know.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena is in her bed. She picks up a picture in a frame from her bedside. The picture is of her and her parents. She looks at it for a moment then places it down on her lap. She grabs the cell phone that she took from the man that was run over. Elena opens the phone and finds the last number that was dialed. Before she can change her mind, Elena calls the number and places the phone to her ear. After a few rings, a woman picks up on the other end.]

Isobel: Was there a problem? Did you find her? What's going on?
Elena: Isobel?
[Isobel hangs up without another word. Elena shuts the phone, looking tearful.]

Miss Gibbons' Residence
[Harper is walking down a path through the woods. He approaches a house and knocks on the door. The woman that Harper saw in the Town Square earlier answers the door.]

Woman: Pearl, it's Harper.
[Pearl and Anna walk to the front door and woman goes back into the house.]

Pearl: I'm glad you found us. Ms. Gibbons, this gentleman is a friend of mine.
[Miss Gibbons comes up from behind Pearl.]

Pearl: May he come in?
Miss Gibbons: Any friend of Pearl's is a friend of mine. Please do. Come in.
Pearl: Annabelle, close the door, please.
[Harper enters the house and walks off with Pearl and Miss Gibbons. Anna looks at into the woods as she shuts the door.]

Miss Gibbons' Residence
[Anna is going down the stairs.]

Anna: Hey Bethanne.
Anna: What are you guys watching? You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time? There are over one hundred and fifty channels. It's called a remote control. This button changes the channel. Hold it like this.
[Anna goes into the dining room and finds Frederick feeding on Miss Gibbons.]

Miss Gibbons: Did you get enough sweetheart?
Frederick: For now.
Miss Gibbons: Anna, are you hungry? Did you want a little?
Anna: No, thank you Miss Gibbons. Why don't you lie down for a while and get some rest?
Frederick: She's fine. Aren't you Miss Gibbons?
[Frederick compels Miss Gibbons.]

Miss Gibbons: Of course I am. I'm fine.
[Miss Gibbons is leaving. Anna and Frederick exchange looks.]

Donovan Residence
Matt: Hey mom! Mom?
[Matt is knocking on his mother's room door.]

Matt: Hey mom?
[Kelly opens the door.]

Kelly: What? I'm trying to sleep.
Matt: I was just making sure you're alive.
Kelly: I'm sorry sweetie. It was a late night. My head is throbbing.
Matt: I would appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home. And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it too.
Kelly: It wasn't a party, it was one guy, don't be so judgy.
Matt: Well, I talked to Roberta at the grill and there's still a bartending position open if you want to...get a job.
Kelly: I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I worked there.
Matt: I think she's desperate.
Kelly: I'll check it out.
Matt: Yeah?
Kelly: Don't act so surprised.
Matt: Well, I mean...I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
Kelly: Well, there's back rent due.
Matt: There's back everything mom.
Kelly: Like I said, I'll check it out.
[Someone is knocking on the door.]

Kelly: Who's that?
Matt: It's Caroline.
[Kelly is making a face.]

Matt: Easy.
[Kelly raises her eyebrows.]

Matt: Yeah come in!
[Caroline opens the door and enters in the kitchen.]

Caroline: Hi Mrs. Donovan.
[Kelly gets up and leaves the room.]

Matt: Hey, ok. Well we're going to be late. So let's get going.
[Matt is going towards Caroline.]

Caroline: Yeah.
Matt: Hey.
Caroline: Hey.
Matt: How are you?
Caroline: Good.
Mystic Falls High School
Stefan: Damon hasn't said a word to me. Every time I try to talk to him he shuts me down.
Elena: Do you think he's still trying to find Katherine?
Stefan: I don't know. He waited a hundred and forty five years only to find out that Katherine could not care less. I mean it's gotta hurt, right?
Elena: And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
Stefan: You have every reason to be upset with him. Have you thought any more about what you're going to do?
Elena: About what? Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's related to my vampire ancestor Katherine, who screwed over your vampire brother? Nah...I haven't thought about it at all.
Stefan: I'm sorry I brought it up.
Elena: It'd just be nice if we could get through one day without having to deal with any of it. No vampire mother or brother.
Stefan: No vampires at all?
Elena: No vampires but you. I just want to get us back to normal stuff like school and homework and here's a thought: fun.
Stefan: Ooh, that sounds good to me, when do we start?
[They laugh and leave.]

Matt: We can watch a movie at my place.
Caroline: With your mom and a six pack?
Matt: You know...you don't really help the situation. You could at least try to be nice.
Caroline: Oh...I'm sorry. It's hard for me to show kindness to people that hate me. I'm not that evolved.
[Matt raises his head and look at Elena and Stefan. They kiss each other. Caroline turns her head and look at them too. And turns her head to look at Matt.]

Caroline: So, a movie tonight?
Matt: Wherever you want to do it's good for me but I'm late and I got to go OK?
Caroline: OK.
[She moves in for a kiss but he leaves.]

Miss Gibbons' Residence
Pearl: The keypad is for texting which is what you do when you want to avoid talking to someone.
[Harper pushes a button and we can hear a message from Jeremy. Anna rushes towards the phone.]

Harper: I didn't break it, I swear.
Pearl: I was just showing Harper what you taught me. What a marvelous device!
Harper: Who was that?
Anna: Jeremy Gilbert.
Harper: Is that your boyfriend?
Pearl: Of course not.
[Pearl gets up and looks at Anna.]

Pearl: What do you think?
Anna: Very respectable.
Pearl: That's the goal. I can't say that I miss corsets.
Anna: Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys and her ATM card.
Pearl: What's that?
Anna: I'll explain later.
[Frederick waits outside the room. Anna and Pearl leaves the room.]

Frederick: Where are you going?
Pearl: We have some business in town. We'll be back as soon as we can. I trust that you'll keep an eye on things.
Frederick: So, I'm the baby sitter now?
Pearl: Frederick, if this is going to work we have to cooperate with one another.
Frederick: So you saying...
Harper: I'll watch things miss Pearl.
Pearl: Thank you Harper.
[Anna and Pearl leaves the room. Harper and Frederick exchange looks.]

Mystic Falls High School
Caroline: I'm thinking nothing huge, just a dinner at the grill maybe a late movie.
Stefan: You mean like a double date?
Caroline: Two pair out on a Friday night coupled. Yeah a double date.
Elena: Do you think that's a good idea?
Caroline: Why not? We all haven't gone out together before and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us. Look the couple dynamics have changed and there's been a little awkwardness between you, Matt, and me and I just think it's important that we get over it.
Elena: I don't know.
Stefan: I think that sounds like a great idea.
Elena: You do?
Stefan: Yeah. A nice evening out with friends. Sounds fun, as in fun.
Elena: A double date it is.
Caroline: Ok. So, we will see you tonight.
Elena: OK.
[Caroline walks away. Elena looks at Stefan.]

Elena: OK.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon enters the house. Anna and Pearl are waiting for him.]

Pearl: Hello Damon.
Damon: Ever hear of knocking?
Pearl: An invitation wasn't necessary. I'm surprised that no living person resides here. Is it just you and your brother?
Anna: Yeah. How do you keep out unwelcome vampires?
Damon: I kill them.
[Damon runs towards Pearl and tries to strangle her. Pearl twists his wrist and pushes him to the floor.]

Pearl: Have a seat, Damon. I was hoping we could have a word.
Damon: Sure.
Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is on his computer in his bedroom chatting on a website entitled The Lair [Vampire Lovers Only].]

Jeremy [on computer as user Vampjer]: How do you become a vampire?
User [username Bloodybecky]: Brad Pitt changed me.
User [username FANG69]: Go to Vegas. Ask for Wayne Newton.
Jeremy [on computer]: How do you kill a vampire?
User [username USUCK14]: The blood of Paula Abdul.
Jeremy [to himself]: Great.
Jeremy [on computer]: Serious answers only please.
User [username Bloodybecky]: Stake in the heart always works.
Jeremy [on computer]: You're a believer?
User [username Bloodybecky]: Aren't you?
Salvatore Boarding House
Pearl: We've taken up residence at a farmhouse just outside the town. It'll suffice for now.
Damon: All 25 vampires?
Pearl: Not all, some. I imagine that a few have already left town. Others are probably still in the woods or like us acclimating.
[Damon looks at Pearl and Anna.]

Damon: How did they get out of the tomb?
Anna: I think the witch screwed up that part of her hocus pocus.
Pearl: I understand from Anna that the founding families still have a secret council?
Anna: And you're a part of it.
Damon: That's ridiculous.
Anna: I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet, Damon. I'm up to speed.
Pearl: And so am I. And now that you've infiltrated the council, I'll need to know everything they know. Starting with a listing names of all the council members and their families.
Anna: And everyone you've supplied with vervain.
Pearl: Yes, that will have to stop immediately.
Damon: What exactly are you trying to achieve?
Pearl: Mystic Falls is our home, Damon. They took that from us. Our land, our home. It's time we rebuild.
Damon: What, are you crazy? It was 1864. Wake up woman. The world has moved on.
Pearl: As a reward for your help I'm willing to give you what you want most.
Damon: I want nothing.
Pearl: Katherine.
Damon: You wouldn't even know where she was. You've been under the ground for the last century and a half.
Pearl: Katherine and I were best friends long before we came to Mystic Falls, Damon. I know how she thinks, I know her patterns, I know where to find her.
Damon: I no longer have any desire to see Katherine ever again. And there's no way in hell I'm gonna play the role of your little minion.
[Pearl gets up and pushes Damon on the couch.]

Pearl: I'm not asking for your help, Damon. Finding Katherine was just a mere gesture of kindness. The rest is non-negotiable.
[She puts her fingers in Damon's eyes and pushes him on the floor.]

Pearl: I have four hundred years on you, little boy. I'll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking and you know it. I'll be in touch.
[Pearl and Anna leave the house.]

Gilbert Residence
[Stefan in knocking on the door. Elena opens it.]

Elena: You got me flowers!
Stefan: I figured it's a date, why not do it right? I would have driven too but you're the one with the car.
Elena: You know, you think that for someone who was around when the car was invented you would have one.
Stefan: Oh, I have one. I just never drive it.
Elena: You know, it's not too late to cancel.
Stefan: Why we would do that?
Elena: I don't know, it just seems surreal. Like maybe we weren't meant to get to the normal part.
Stefan: That's exactly why we're going to do it. We're going to go out, have some fun and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious. Listen, when I decided to stay here and to get to know you, it so that I could do things like this. Bring my girlfriend flowers, take her out on a date, and try to be normal.
Elena: Have you ever even been on a double date before?
Stefan: Oh, absolutely. '72, Hef and the twins.
Elena: What?
Stefan: Yeah...playmates. I got Miss June.
Elena: Are you serious?
Mystic Falls
[Jenna is waiting for Anna and Pearl in front of her brother in law's office.]

Pearl: Miss Sommers?
Jenna: Yes. Hi Pearl.
Pearl: Hi. This is my Daughter, Annabelle.
Jenna: Of course, Jeremy's friend.
Anna: Nice to see you, Miss Sommers.
Jenna: Oh, Jenna, please. This property was in my brother in law's family for generations. It's one of the originals structure in Mystic Falls. It used to be one of those old fashioned drugstore thingies.
Pearl: An apothecary?
Jenna: Yeah.
Pearl: You don't say.
[Anna sees Jeremy.]

Jenna: Sorry if it's a little musty.
[Anna is watching Jeremy walking.]

Jenna: No one has been here for months.
Pearl: I'll use my imagination.
[Anna is still watching Jeremy.]

Pearl: Annabelle?
Anna: I'm coming mother.
[They are entering the office. Jenna is holding the door.]

Mystic Grill
[Kelly is at the bar. Damon sits down next to her. He wears sunglasses.]

Kelly: What's with the glasses inside?
Damon: My eyes were a little sensitive today.
Kelly: You're new around here.
Damon: On the contrary, I'm very old.
[Talking to the bartender.]

Damon: Bourbon, neat.
Kelly: I haven't been gone that long. I would remember someone who looked like you.
Damon: Yeah. Where did you go?
Kelly: Around, about.
Damon: I've been there.
Kelly: I love to see a man drown his sorrows. It's so sexy.
Damon: It's more like nursing my wounds. And you?
Kelly: I was supposed interviewing for the bartender job but I think the manager blew me off.
Damon: Well, that's not very nice.
Kelly: Yeah. Last time I was in town I slept with her boyfriend.
Damon: That's not very nice either.
Kelly: It happens.
Damon: Yes it does.
[Jenna arrives.]

Jenna: Kelly? Kelly Donovan?
Kelly: Jenna!
[They hug each other.]

Jenna: I heard you were back in town. [To Damon] She used to babysit me.
Kelly: And then I used to party with her.
Jenna: This woman is crazy.
Kelly: Not as crazy as you.
Jenna: I'm not anymore.
Kelly: Well sit, drink!
Jenna: I shouldn't. I'm more responsible now. Haven't you heard?
Kelly: Well, take a night off its good for the soul.
Damon: Great for the soul.
[Jenna sits down with Kelly and Damon.]

Jenna: This is not going to end well.
Damon: Can't wait.
[They raise their glasses and clink their glasses.]

Miss Gibbons' Residence
Frederick: I hate this house.
Bethanne: It's better than the tomb.
Frederick: I didn't stay locked up for a hundred and forty five years to end up locked here.
Harper: Maybe you should quit complaining.
[Frederick gets up and walks toward Harper.]

Frederick: You're going to stop me?
Bethanne: Let it be Frederick. You heard what Pearl said.
Frederick: I don't care what Pearl said. [To Harper] What you got boy?
[Harper gets up and pushes Frederick on the couch. Frederick pushes Harper against the wall.]

Frederick: Try that again.
[Pearl arrives and strangles Frederick.]

Pearl: Back off. Back off! We don't fight each other. Those are the rules.
Frederick: And I'm tired of your rules. I want out of this house. Why can't we go out on the town?
Pearl: Eventually. But for now we have to keep a low profile.
Frederick: No one knows who I am.
Pearl: The Salvatore's brothers do.
Frederick: And I wish to hell that I could run into them. There are the reason we were caught in the first place.
Mystic Grill
Elena: So, Matt, How do you like working here?
Matt: It's not that bad. Wait staff is pretty good and they can't keep a bartender to save their lives. I actually put my mom up for a job.
Elena: How has that been? Having Kelly back?
Matt: You know, same old Kelly. She's trying, sort of.
Elena: Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up. That's how Matt and I first met, we shared a crib together.
Stefan: You're kidding?
Matt: No, we have known each other our whole lives.
[Elena and Matt look each other. Caroline sighs. Everyone turn their heads and watch Damon, Kelly and Jenna drinking together.]

Matt: You got to be kidding me.
Miss Gibbons' Residence
[Frederick and Bethanne are going out the house. Harper catches them.]

Harper: Where are you going?
Frederick: Bethanne and I are going out for a bit. Hit the town, kick up our heels.
Harper: We're not supposed to leave. Miss Pearl made that very clear.
Frederick: You're going to stop me? I didn't think so.
[Harper watches them while they leave the house.]

Gilbert Residence
[Someone is knocking on the door. Jeremy goes down the stairs and opens the door. It's Anna.]

Jeremy: Anna?
Anna: Surprised?
Jeremy: I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
Anna: Change of plans. Sorry, I thought you'd be psyched.
Jeremy: No, no, no. I mean...I am. Of course I am.
Anna: Alright then, step aside.
[Anna enters in the house.]

Mystic Grill
Jenna: Don't be grumpy. It can't be that bad.
Damon: You'd be surprised. My primary reason for existence has abandoned me and after today's events, the remains of the shakey ground that I walk on are about to go kaboom. Let's get hammered.
Kelly: Let's.
[They clink their glasses.]

[Caroline, Elena, Stefan and Matt are at the pool table. They're watching Damon, Kelly and Jenna.]

Caroline: At least they're having fun.
Elena: They're drunk.
Matt: Remember when Elena's parents busted us here after the homecoming?
Caroline [laughing]: Oh my god yes!
Elena: Well, we were wasted; it was the first time I ever got drunk. I blame Matt.
Matt: Her parents got seated at the next booth.
Elena: And Matt had me pretend that I was choking so we could get away.
Matt: Except that her dad was a doctor so he jumped up to save her.
Elena: And I ran, slipped on the wet floor and bit it in front of everyone. Do you remember that? 3 stitches, a hangover for days and I was grounded from seeing this one [She looks at Matt] for a week.
[Matt and Elena look at each other and laugh.]

Caroline: I'm gonna go to the restroom. Elena?
[Jenna sees them.]

Jenna: Hide. We're not here.
Kelly: Why? Where'd we go?
Jenna: Children under our care. Five o'clock. This is not good.
[Kelly turns her head and sees them.]

Kelly: Damn!
Gilbert Residence
Jeremy: What made you and your mom decide to stay in town?
Anna: She got this business opportunity; she's going to open up a little store. It has always been her dream. So yeah we're staying. And I'm thinking about going back to high school, so you'll be seeing a little more of me.
Jeremy: Yeah?
Anna: Enough of homeschooling. I'd like to be a normal teen for once. But I have to ask my mom first, she'll have an opinion.
Jeremy: Well, I wish you were there now. I actually have to write another paper. I was thinking about squeezing one more out on the vampire in Mystic Falls.
Anna: Really? Haven't you exhausted the subject?
Jeremy: No, I want to go deeper, you know. I want to understand why people were labelled as vampires back in the day. I mean, maybe there's such a thing has vampires, they're just different from the way we always thought they were.
Anna: What do you mean?
Jeremy: Well, maybe they're normal and good, just outsiders you know? Um, misunderstood.
Anna: You're kidding, right?
Jeremy: Don't you think it could be possible? You did give me all that info.
Anna: Jeremy, I made it up ok? You were all cute and floppy and I wanted to make a good impression.
Mystic Grill
Matt: Is there anything you're not good at?
Stefan: Double dating. This is all kind of new to me. I usually keep to myself. I don't always fit in.
Matt: That's because you're that guy.
Stefan: What guy?
Matt: The guy who seems like he has everything, so the people that don't, kind of run the other way.
Stefan: Is that what I seem like?
Matt: Pretty much.
Stefan: Hmm...What a dick!
Matt: Yeah.
[In the restroom, Elena is washing her hands. Caroline is sitting behind her.]

Caroline: So um, what are you doing?
Elena: What?
Caroline: Well the point of this was to show him how much you care about Stefan. You know, not to hopscotch down memory lane.
Elena: I was just trying to make conversation.
Caroline: Try less.
[Caroline leaves the restroom, Elena run after her.]

Elena: Caroline.
[Back in the bar, Elena is walking after Caroline, and passes Frederick. He sees her and catches her arm.]

Frederick: Katherine?
Elena: I'm sorry, you have the wrong person.
[Caroline is waiting for Elena.]

Caroline: Elena, come on!
Frederick: My mistake.
[They return to the pool table with Matt and Stefan. Frederick looks at her.]

Elena: How's everything going?
Stefan: Matt's cheating.
Matt: No need, I'm awesome.
Frederick [watching them]: Stefan Salvatore.
Stefan [to Elena]: Everything okay?
Elena: Everything's great.
[She writes him a text message and shows it to him.]

Elena: That man over there just called me Katherine
[He walks toward them but they're already gone.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena parks her car. She discusses with Stefan.]

Stefan: So, you didn't recognize him, you haven't seen him before?
Elena: No, there was nothing familiar about him at all.
Stefan: Right, let's call it a night. OK? Send Matt and Caroline home?
Elena: No, the whole point of the night was to not have to deal with this stuff. We need to get through one night. One normal night.
Stefan: You're sure?
Elena: No, I'm not sure, but I don't know what else to do. Look, if there's another vampire in town, he'll still be here tomorrow. We'll deal with it tomorrow.
Stefan: OK.
[Matt and Caroline arrive. Matt parks his car.]

Stefan: It's them. Come here.
[Stefan kisses Elena.]

[Caroline, Matt, Stefan and Elena are entering the living room.]

Caroline: This is much better than watching Damon visit cougar town. [To Matt.] No offence.
Matt: Don't remind me. [To Stefan]: Man I've always wanted to see what it looks like in this place.
Stefan: Yeah, I guess it's a bit much.
Matt: Yeah, my entire house could fit in here. like twice.
Caroline: Feel like I've been here before. It's weird.
[Elena is uncomfortable and changes the subject.]

Elena: Do you guys want to watch a movie or something?
Matt: Whoa; these are great!
[He walks towards Stefan's miniature cars collection.]

Stefan: This is uh...a little hobby of mine.
Matt: I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9
Stefan: You like cars?
Matt: It's an understatement.
Stefan: Come with me.
Mystic Grill
[Damon is playing with a cherry.]

Damon: So, the thing about cherries, you have to...
[Kelly puts her finger on Damon's lips. She puts a cherry in her mouth.]

Damon: Oh my goodness.
[He takes the cherry out of Kelly's mouth with his mouth.]

Damon: That's amazing, you were fast.
Jenna: That would be my cue.
Kelly [looking at Damon]: You're given up already?
Jenna: Oh yeah.
[She leaves the bar.]

Jenna: See you guys.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan opens the garage door.]

Stefan: Prepare yourself, my friend.
[He removes a tarp from a car.]

Matt: Wait, how do you have this?
Stefan: Got passed down through the family.
[He opens the car's door.]

Matt: Why don't you...I mean...Why don't you drive it?
Stefan: Well, it doesn't run. I mean, it's not that I could figure out.
Caroline: Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
Matt: Be more of a girl right now?
[Caroline laugh.]

Stefan [to Matt]: Hey, want to come take a look at this for me?
Matt: Elena, remember the old Camaro you're dad used to have?
Elena: Of course.
Matt: I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
Stefan: wow.
Caroline: I don't like sports cars; they're too hard to make out in.
Matt [looking at Elena]: It wasn't that bad.
[Elena and Matt look at each other, uncomfortable. Caroline leaves the garage. Elena goes after her.]

Matt [to Stefan]: I'm sorry man.
Stefan: No, no, no. Don't worry about it. You and Elena, you guys have a history and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good.
Matt: She's good with you. You know, I wasn't sure but she's happy and I'm glad.
[They look at each other.]

Matt: Alright, let's take a look at this.
Mystic Grill
[Jenna is going out. She breaks her heel. Frederick looks at her.]

Frederick: Need some help?
Jenna: Damn it! Stupid shoe.
Frederick: Pick up your other foot.
[He breaks the other heel and gives it to Jenna.]

Frederick: Here you go.
Jenna: Thanks, I think.
Frederick: Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
Jenna: The one and only. You know him?
Frederick: We go way back. He still live out by Miller Lane?
Jenna: He lives in the old boarding house by Wickery Bridge. He's still in there if you want to say hi.
Frederick: I prefer to stay here and talk to you.
Jenna: Oh, nice. Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt. But, I'm a little drunk and a guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.
[Frederick touches her face and tries to compel her.]

Frederick: I'm pretty sure you'd like it.
[She laughs.]

Jenna: Sorry. That was a seriously lame pick up.
Frederick: That is a nice scent you wear. What is it?
Jenna: I don't know [she laughs] it was a gift. And that is a cab so...
[She leaves. Frederick looks at her. Bethanne arrives behind him.]

Frederick: Vervain...making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena arrives to talk to Caroline.]

Elena: Caroline...
Caroline: I don't want to talk about it.
Elena: You're being ridiculous.
Caroline: And insecure and stupid. But that doesn't change the fact that Matt's always gonna be in love with you and I'm always gonna be the back up.
Elena: You're not the back up.
Caroline: Yes I'm. I'm Matt's Elena back up; I'm your Bonnie back up.
Elena: Now it's about me and Bonnie?
Caroline: You don't get it. Why would you? You're everyone's first choice.
[They look at each other. Stefan and Matt pull up in the Porsche. They get out of the car.]

Matt: Piece of cake!
[Matt looks at Caroline.]

Stefan: You know what? Why don't you guys go ahead and take it for a spin?
Matt: Really?
Stefan: Yeah.
Matt: Caroline?
[Matt and Caroline get into the car. Stefan and Elena watch them go. Stefan embraces Elena.]

Stefan: You alright?
Elena: If it's not vampires, its girlfriends.
[They embrace each other.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy and Anna are in the kitchen.]

Jeremy: Alright. Roast beef, turkey, what do you want?
Anna: Let's do the works. Pile it high.
Jeremy: Ok, I like your style. Will you grab the bread for me?
Anna: Ok.
[She turns to get the bread. Jeremy cuts his hand with a knife.]

Anna: What are you doing?
Jeremy: It's just a cut. Can you hand me that towel?
[She looks uncomfortable.]

Anna: I can't.
Jeremy: You got a problem with blood Anna?
[He shows her his bloody hand and goes towards her.]

Jeremy: What's the matter? It's just blood, Anna.
[She grabs him by the neck and pushes him against the fridge.]

Anna: What are you doing?
[Her face changes.]

Jeremy: I knew it. [He shows her his hand] Go for it.
[She takes his hand and begins to drink. Jenna enters. Jeremy rushes towards her.]

Jeremy: Jenna! Hey, what's up?
Jenna: Regret. Make sure you lock that up.
[Jenna goes upstairs. Jeremy looks back into the kitchen, Anna has gone. He looks at his hand and smiles.]

Woods
[Matt and Caroline are driving in Stefan's car through the woods.]

Matt: Did I just pass the driveway?
Caroline: Uh...No, I think it's up there.
Matt: This is an amazing car. Did I pass?
[Caroline doesn't understand.]

Matt: The whole double date thing was obviously a test to see how I would do around Elena.
Caroline: I don't know. You were reminiscing about the Elena years the whole night so...
Matt: Caroline that stuff came before. It's not just gonna go away.
Caroline: I know that okay? I know.
Matt: No, you don't. Because, you're letting Elena turn you into a crazy person. Look it's my fault. I made it pretty clear early on that Elena still means something to me. But all that talk, that was just two old friends and some memories. Tonight wasn't about me and Elena. I was there because I wanted to be with you. And I don't know what this means or what we are but I do know that you are the only person I want to be in this car with right now. And I don't even know if that makes sense because I'm not really that good at expressing myself.
Caroline: No, no. I think you're doing just fine.
[They laugh and kiss each other. Caroline hurts herself.]

Caroline: Sports cars...
Matt: Yeah.
[They kiss each other again.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon and Kelly enter the house. Damon makes a drink, takes a sip, and hands it to Kelly.]

[He kisses her. He pushes her against the wall. They kiss each other. Caroline and Matt enter the house and interrupt them.]

Matt: Mom?!
Caroline: Damon?!
Kelly: Oh my god, Matt! Oh my god.
[She takes her things and leaves. Elena and Stefan arrive.]

Matt: I got to...
Caroline: It's fine, just go.
Elena [to Matt]: I'll take her home.
Matt: Thanks, man.
[Matt gives the keys to Stefan and leaves. Caroline, Elena and Stefan look at Damon. He drinks.]

Miss Gibbons' Residence
[Anna is going into the house. She tries to be discreet. Pearl arrives.]

Pearl: Where have you been?
Anna: I needed some air.
Pearl: For three hours? Tell me, where have you been?
Anna: Out, I was out.
Pearl: Annabelle, don't do this. I can't fight you too. What?
Anna: I'm sorry.
[Pearl embraces her.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena and Stefan walk out to her car.]

Elena: Sorry I'm bailing.
Stefan: Just wish you let me drive you home.
Elena: Normal people don't have chaperones or bodyguards or baby-sitters. We're normal tonight, remember?
Stefan: I know, I just get so worry about you.
Elena: Stefan, I can't live every minute afraid that someone is gonna come after me. I won't, it's not living.
Stefan: Okay. Call me when you get home safe.
[He takes her face and kisses her. Stefan opens her car door for her and Elena gets in.]

Caroline: Bye Stefan.
Stefan: Goodbye.
[He closes the car's door. He watches them leave and goes back inside. Frederick watches him while he closes the door.]

[Inside, Damon is in the living room. Stefan arrives and looks at him.]

Damon: Don't look at me like that.
Stefan: Are you crazy?
Damon: Save the lecture. Look...
[Frederick jumps through the window, jumps on Stefan and stabs him with a piece of glass. Damon pushes him off Stefan and starts to fight with Frederick. Stefan removes the piece of glass. Bethanne arrives and begins to fight with Stefan. She pushes him to the floor, he takes the leg off a wooden chair and stabs her in the heart. Damon sends Frederick across the living room. Frederick looks at Damon and Stefan and then looks at Bethanne, who is dead. He leaves. Stefan looks at Damon.]

Damon: Damn it.
Stefan: I remember them from 1864. They were in the tomb.
Damon: Yeah...About that.
[They look at each other.]

Donovan Residence
[Matt is going into the living room. Kelly goes after him.]

Kelly: Matt...Matt....
Matt: I don't want to hear it, mom.
Kelly: Matty, please...
Matt: Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom? I was having fun, you know, trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day. Just enjoying a night with my friends. And then, there you are, wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way, to pay the bills that you don't pay. And then you're off acting like a freakin' kid, hooking up with some guy half your age. I'm the kid, Mom. You're supposed to be responsible for me.
Kelly: I know Matt.
[He looks at her and leaves.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is in the bathroom, she brushes her teeth. Jeremy arrives.]

Miss Gibbons' Residence
[Pearl is taking a bottle of blood from the fridge. Frederick arrives.]

Pearl: So, where's Bethanne?
Frederick: She won't be coming back.
Pearl: What happened? Where is she?
Frederick: Well, you were right.[He looks at Anna] We shouldn't have left.
Pearl: No. Hungry?
[Frederick is still looking at Anna. Pearl is pouring blood in a glass. She takes the glass and a wooden spoon. She holds the glass to Frederick and stabs him with the spoon. She puts down the glass and throws the spoon in the sink. She sits down and pours blood in a glass.]

Pearl: Next time you'll listen to me.
[Anna smiles and looks at Frederick.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is on the phone with Stefan.]

Elena: I'm home, teeth brushed, and ready for bed. Save and sound.
Stefan: Good, good. I'm glad.
Elena: Is everything alright? You sound serious.
Stefan: No, no, no, no. Not tonight, you still have a few minutes left of normal. I'll tell you about it tomorrow okay?
Elena: I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
Stefan: Such a liar.
Elena: No, I'm serious. In a way it was exactly what it was supposed to be.
Stefan: I had a really nice time too.
[Elena hangs up.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is dragging Bethanne's body into the fireplace.]

Damon [to Stefan]: Could you help me out a little bit?
Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy enters his bedroom. Anna's there, Jeremy is scared.]

Jeremy: What the hell?
Anna: I could have killed you!
Jeremy: Yeah, but you didn't.
Anna: I should have.
Jeremy: But you didn't.
Anna: How did you know?
Jeremy: I knew this girl. Vicki. She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck. She started acting crazy, weird, and it seemed like drugs, but then you showed me those articles. And then I saw your face and how it changed the night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
Anna: You know you can't tell anyone, right?
Jeremy: Who would believe me?
Anna: You'd be surprised.
Jeremy: Why didn't you kill me?
Anna: I don't know. Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.
Jeremy: Like what?
Anna: Lost. Why would you confront me about it? Why would you risk it?
Jeremy: Because if it was true, maybe it's true about Vicki. And also because...I want you to turn me.

Gilbert Residence
[A storm is starting outside. Elena is asleep in her bed. The wind from the storm blows her bedroom window open and Elena wakes with a start. She goes over to the window and closes it. In Jeremy's room, Anna is looking at the storm outside of his window.]

Anna: I love storms.
Jeremy: Is that a vampire thing? Cause I read vampires don't like running water.
Anna: It's only Dracula. Yeah. He was a complete wuss. Never showered. Very smelly.
Jeremy: Seriously?
Anna: First rule about vampires, don't believe anything you read.
Jeremy: You gotta tell me more. I gotta know.
Anna: No, you don't. Cause you're not gonna be one.
Jeremy: Come on, you can't keep saying no to me.
Anna: Look, I'm not gonna turn someone who learned everything he knows about vampires from Netflix.
Jeremy: That's not true, and you know it.
Anna: Why do you even want this? Give me one good reason.
Jeremy: Cause I...
Anna: Hmm. Let me know when you can finish that sentence.
[Elena knocks on Jeremy's door and enters his room. Anna leaves.]

Elena: Hey, you're still up.
Jeremy: Hey, what's up?
Elena: Looks like the there's a big storm rolling in. Can you help make sure all the windows are closed?
Jeremy: Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

Miss Gibbons' Residence
[Pearl comes to talk with Frederick.]

Frederick: We're running low on blood. You might wanna send Anna to the hospital for some more.
Pearl: I'll send her out for some tomorrow.
Frederick: Maybe I could go with her. If the storm keeps it dark enough, I might be able to go out during the day, no sun and all.
Pearl: I'm afraid not. Not after your stunt at the Salvatore house tonight.
Frederick: He and his brother deserved it.
Pearl: And where did that get you? Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead. And you have no one to blame but yourself. We cannot live our lives about revenge. We have to have better control of our emotions.
Frederick: I understand, Miss Pearl. I just wish I knew what you were up to.
Pearl: I'm going to make an exploratory visit into town tomorrow to assess who's under the influence of vervain and who isn't. Anna tells me that the players haven't changed much. It's still the Lockwoods, the Forbes, the Fells...
Frederick: We should kill every last one of them.
Pearl: We are smarter than that, Frederick. These people are not our enemies. We don't hold grudges and resentments. We'll get our town back. We just have to have patience.
[Pearl leaves. Other vampires enter the room.]

Frederick: You heard her. No revenge. Patience. Self-control. She seems to have it all figured out, doesn't she?
[Frederick holds up a wooden stake he's been carving.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon boards up the window that Frederick and Beth-Anne broke through. Stefan and Elena watch him.]

Damon: I say we go to Pearl's, bust down the door, and annihilate the idiot that attacked us last night.
Stefan: Yeah. And then what? We turn to the rest of that house of vampires and say, Oops. Sorry?
Elena: I can't believe you made a deal with her.
Damon: It was more like a helpful exchange of information. And it's not like I had a choice. She's...scary. Besides, she's gonna help me get Katherine back.
Elena: Of course she is. Damon gets what he wants, as usual. No matter who he hurts in the process.
Damon: You don't have to be snarky about it.
Elena: I woke up this morning to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb. I've earned snarky.
Damon: How long are you going to blame me for turning your birth mother into a vampire?
Elena: I'm not blaming you, Damon. I've accepted the fact that you're a self-serving psychopath with no redeeming qualities.
Damon: Ouch.
Stefan: This isn't being very productive. We're gonna figure out a way to deal with Pearl and the vampires. Yeah? Hmm.
[Damon leaves the room. Stefan embraces Elena.]

Elena: I'm sorry. He just makes me so cranky.
Stefan: I know. He makes everybody cranky.
Elena: So, what are we going to do?
Stefan: Damon and I are gonna handle everything, I promise.
Elena: Well, what about me? I can't just sit here and do nothing.
Stefan: That's exactly what you're gonna do, because that's what going to keep you safe.
Elena: Which means nothing if you're not safe, too.
Stefan: What do you mean? I'm perfectly safe. I have Damon, the self-serving psychopath on my side.
Elena: Well, that's comforting.
Mystic Grill
[Jeremy talks with Anna.]

Anna: Okay. We have some time. I'm not meeting my mom until later.
Jeremy: Wait. Does your mom know you're a...
Anna: The fact that you would even think it's possible to keep something like that a secret from your own family is just further proof that you're not ready.
Jeremy: Not ready Is a step up from No.
Anna: And a million steps down from Maybe. I like your bracelet.
Jeremy: Thanks. My sister got it for me.
Anna: Can I see it?
Jeremy: Yeah. Yeah.
Anna: Your sister doesn't know you're hanging out with me, does she?
Jeremy: No. No. But I don't see why it would be a problem. It's not like she knows what you are.
Anna: I'd rather keep it our little secret.
Jeremy: You know, why don't you...why don't you keep this?
Anna: Why would you give this to me?
Jeremy: Because. You like it. And I like you.
Anna: You only like me because of what you want from me.
Jeremy: No. I...I like you.
Anna: Um...You know, you should wear it. It looks better on you anyway.
[Matt is talking with Caroline.]

Matt: I yelled at my mom last night. You know, I feel like the parent yelling at the screwed up kid.
Caroline: Maybe she needed to hear it.
Matt: Yeah, but just...I worry that if I push too hard, then she will take off again. Cause that's her M.O. Just like Vicki, who I haven't heard from since she left.
Caroline: Well, you can't control your mom, Matt, any more than you can control your sister.
Matt: I wish that she would just try a little. You know? If she would just try to try, that'd be okay.
Caroline: Maybe she'll surprise you. People have a tendency to do that. I should go before the roads get even worse from the storm.
Matt: Yeah. Are you sure you should be driving right now?
Caroline: I have to. It's my dad's boyfriend's daughter's birthday. We have a non-traditional traditional ritual.
Matt: Well, buckle up. Don't speed. Stay off your cell phone. And call me when you get there.
Caroline: Got it. Anything else?
Matt: Yes.
[Matt kisses her.]

Caroline: Bye.
Matt: Bye.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is fixing a clock. Stefan is leaving to go hunt.]

Damon: Hunting party?
Stefan: That guy did a number on me last night when he stabbed me. I gotta get my strength back up.
Damon: I've got two liters of soccer mom in the fridge. No?
Stefan: We'll talk when I get back?
Damon: All right. Give my regards to the squirrels.

[Stefan is out hunting. He turns around and there are vampires surrounding him. Frederick stabs him with a wooden stake.]

Stefan: Aah!
Gilbert Residence
[Elena's phone is ringing. She notices it's Damon and ignores it. She hears a knock on the door and answers it. Damon enters.]

Damon: You're ignoring me.
Elena: The 6 missed calls? Sorry. My phone is dead.
Damon: Is Stefan here?
Elena: No. Why? Something wrong?
Damon: He went out in the woods and didn't come back. I can't get him on his phone. I figured he was here with you.
Elena: It's going straight to voice-mail. Where could he be?
Damon: You're not going to like what I'm thinking.
Miss Gibbons' Residence
[Damon knocks on the door.]

Damon: Pearl! Open this door. I swear to God I'll bust through and rip your head off.
[Frederick opens the door]

Frederick: Pearl's not home. Hmm. Beautiful weather. Not a ray of sun in the sky.
Damon: Where's my brother?
Frederick: Billy.
[Two vampires drag Stefan into the hallway.]

Damon: You're dead.
Frederick: Whoa. I'm sorry. You haven't been invited in. Miss Gibbons?
[She enters.]

Miss Gibbons: Yes, Frederick, honey?
Frederick: Never let this bad man in.
Miss Gibbons: I'll never let him in.
Stefan: Ugh!
Frederick: 145 years left starving in a tomb, thanks to Katherine's infatuation with you and your brother. First few weeks, every single nerve in your body screams with fire. The kind of pain that can drive a person mad. Well...I thought your brother might want to get a taste of that before I killed him. Billy.
[Billy stabs Stefan with a stake.]

Stefan: Uhh! Aah!
Frederick: You have a nice day.
Woods
[Elena is sitting in Damon's car. She sees him approaching and gets out.]

Elena: What happened? Where is he?
Damon: They have him. I can't get in.
Elena: Why not?
Damon: Because the woman who owns the house is compelled to not let me in.
Elena: I can get in.
Damon: You're not going in there.
Elena: I'm going!
Damon: You're not going in there.
Elena: Why are they doing this? What do they want with him?
Damon: Revenge. They want revenge.
Elena: We gotta do something.
Damon: I know.
Elena: We can't let them hurt him. We gotta get him out of there.
Damon: I know. Elena, I know. But I don't know how to get him out.
Miss Gibbons' Residence
[The tomb vampires are tying Stefan up in the basement with ropes soaked in vervain.]

Frederick: Vervain on the ropes.
Stefan: Aah! Unh!
Frederick: That's gotta sting. Speaking of...
[Frederick has an eye dropper with vervain. He puts a few drops into Stefan's eyes.]

Stefan: Aah!
[Harper enters]

Harper: This isn't right!
Frederick: He killed Beth-Anne. One of us, Harper. And don't you think for a second he wouldn't kill you if he had the chance. Pearl says we're not here for revenge, right? I say that's exactly what we're here for. Starting with this.
[Frederick drags a knife across Stefan's chest.]

Stefan: Aah! Aah!
Frederick: And then his brother. And anyone else that gets in our way.
Harper: This isn't right!
Frederick: You're gonna want to let go of me!
Harper: Miss Pearl will be home soon.
Frederick: Miss Pearl is no longer in charge. Tie him up! And then stake him down.
Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric is walking down the hallway when Damon appears. Alaric stops in his tracks.]

Damon: Well, don't you look...alive?
Alaric: You can't hurt me.
Damon: Oh, I can hurt you, all right.
Elena: Mr. Saltzman. We need your help.
[They go into Alaric's classroom to talk.]

Elena: Stefan's in the house. Damon's a vampire. He can't get in. We need you. I would go, but...
Damon: But your life is valuable. Yours, on the other hand is...
Elena: Stefan told me about your ring.
Alaric: What about it?
Damon: Let me recap...You tried to kill me. I defended myself. You died. Then according to my brother, your ring brought you back to life. Am I leaving anything out?
Alaric: Yeah. The part where I try and kill you again. Only this time, I don't miss.
Elena: Mr. Saltzman. Please. It's Stefan.
Alaric: I'm sorry, Elena. But it's not my problem.
Damon: That's a shame. Because the woman in charge of the crowd can help you find your wife.
Alaric: You're lying.
Damon: Am I? Why don't you ask her for yourself? Coward. Come on, Elena.
[Damon and Elena start to leave.]

Alaric: All right! Wait. I'll go.
Mystic Grill
[Jeremy and Anna are talking.]

Jeremy: So, I have an answer.
Anna: To what?
Jeremy: Why you should turn me.
Anna: We're back to that?
Jeremy: Look, I wake up every day, and I feel okay, but there's something missing. Like a...like a hole. Some people, they fit...in life, or whatever. I...I don't.
Anna: So, you want a pity-turn? I don't think so.
Jeremy: You should turn me because I don't have anything else.
Anna: Do you even know why we turn other people? It's not to give someone a one-way ticket out of loner-hood. Okay? One, we need someone to do our dirty work. Two, revenge. Three, boredom...but, you know, that never turns out well. And then you know there's the obvious one. You love someone so much that you would do anything to spend all of eternity with them. Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't fit any of those categories yet.
[Anna sees her mother enter the Grill.]

Anna: So, yeah. Just make sure your thesis is clear, and she'll love it. See you later.
[Anna sends a text to Jeremy. She joins her mother.]

Anna: Mom, hey.
Pearl: Did you get everything?
Anna: Yeah, the blood-bank was understaffed because of the rain. I was in and out.
Pearl: Who's that you were talking to?
Anna: A friend from the library.
Pearl: Let's get home.
[Mayor Richard Lockwood and Tyler enter the grill.]

Mr. Lockwood: Hey, you're not going out in that, are ya? The roads are dangerous. Route 5 is completely flooded.
Pearl: We'll make do.
Waitress: Mayor Lockwood, we have your table ready.
Tyler: Great.
Pearl: Mayor...Lockwood, is it? I suppose it is treacherous outside. My name is Pearl.
Mr. Lockwood: Hi.
Pearl: This is my daughter Anna. We've just recently moved to town.
Mr. Lockwood: Welcome. Richard Lockwood. This is my son Tyler. Please--please, join us.
Pearl: It would be a pleasure.
Tyler: Be more creepy, dad. Not like your son is standing right here.
Mr. Lockwood: Grow up. Elections are coming. She's a constituent. And a rich one, from the looks of it.
Tyler: You can tell all that by looking at her ass? Awesome. I'm gonna go shoot some pool.
Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric in his classroom pulls out his arsenal of vampire weapons.]

Damon: Teacher by day, vampire hunter by night.
Alaric: I've you to thank for that.
Elena: What are these?
Alaric: Those are tranquilizer darts filled with vervain.
Damon: Just get me in. I'll get Stefan out.
Elena: That's your plan? You're just gonna take them all on yourself?
Damon: Well, I'll be a little stealthier than that, hopefully.
[Elena takes one of the vervain darts.]

Alaric: Whoa. What are you doing?
Elena: I'm going with you guys.
Damon: No. No. No. No. No way.
Elena: You need me. I'll get in. You could distract them, and then I'll get Stefan out.
Damon: You'll get yourself killed. You're not going in there.
Elena: I'm going.
Damon: So, when you get me in, get out as quickly as you can. I know how to sneak around where they can't hear me. You'll basically just be in the way.
Elena: Damon, now is not the time to be the lone ranger.
Damon: Fine. Elena, you can drive the getaway car. You're not going in the house.
Elena: You can't stop me. It's Stefan we're talking about here. You don't understand.
Damon: Oh, I understand. I understand. He's the reason you live. His love lifts you up where you belong. I get it.
Elena: Can you just not joke around for 2 seconds?
Damon: I can't protect you, Elena. I don't know how many vampires there are in there. That's how long it takes you to get your head ripped off. I have to be able to get in and get out. I can't be distracted with your safety. Or this will end up a bloodbath that none of us walk away from...Including Stefan. I know. I get it. I understand.
Alaric: If we're gonna go, let's go.
Mystic Grill and Caroline's Car
[Matt calls Caroline.]

Matt: Where are you? I can barely hear you.
Caroline: Storm washed out Route 5. Now I'm detoured on some random backwoods path to hell.
Matt: Well, you shouldn't be talking while you're driving.
Caroline: I know, right? I need one of those little bluetooth thingies.
Matt: Look, you're breaking up. Just turn around and go back the same way you came. And watch the road. Okay?
Caroline: Okay.

Alaric: Oh, good, someone's home. Uh, could I use your phone? My car broke down a few miles up the road. This was the first house I saw.
Frederick: Well, lucky you.
Alaric: Yeah. Lucky me. It's no trouble, is it?
Frederick: Not in the slightest.
Alaric: Great. Whew.
[Alaric enters the house]

Alaric: Hey, man, I really appreciate it. It's rough out there.
Frederick: Billy, show our visitor where the phone is in the kitchen. And get me something to drink.
Billy: Yeah. Sure thing.
Billy: Hey, Miss Gibbons, this guy wants to use your phone.
Miss Gibbons: Oh, sure, honey. It's right there.
Alaric: Thanks.
[Alaric walks towards the phone, Billy comes at him with a stake. Alaric is too quick for him and grabs the stake and stabs him with it.]

Billy: Aah!
[Alaric turns on the faucet and starts the blender to create noise.]

Miss Gibbons: What's happening?
Alaric: I'm really sorry. But you're gonna need to invite a friend of mine inside.
[Alaric opens the door and Damon is standing outside.]

Miss Gibbons: Oh, I'm sorry. He's not allowed in the house.
Alaric: I know that. But you've gotta make an exception.
Damon: Get her out of the house. Now! Miss Gibbons, tell me the truth. Are you married?
Miss Gibbons: No.
Damon: Parents, children, anyone else who lives on this property?
Miss Gibbons: No. It's just me.
Damon: No? Good.
[Damon breaks her neck and promptly enters the house]

Alaric: You were supposed to compel her.
Damon: It doesn't work that way...
Alaric: She is human.
Damon: And I'm not! So, I don't care. Now, get out of here. And get rid of the body!

Pearl: I'm in the process of obtaining some property. I understand that your family is the largest property owner in town.
Mr. Lockwood: Well, yes we are. Dating all the way back to the town's original charter.
Pearl: Your family came into a lot of new property in 1864.
Mr. Lockwood: You know your history.
Pearl: It's a passion of mine.
Tyler: Guy's not even subtle about it.
Matt: Who is that?
Tyler: It's not my mother.

[Elena jumps onto the porch. She stays by the wall to keep herself hidden. She starts to move on, but hears Frederick.]

Frederick: Billy, Jacob, get back in here!
[Elena runs past the door and goes down a staircase that leads to the cellar. She tries to open the door, but it is locked. She busts out one of the windowpanes, unlocks the door and opens it. A man is standing guard by a door at the end of the hallway. Elena gets her vervain syringe out and is ready to attack, but Damon gets to the man first. He sees Elena.]

Damon: Are you insane?

Mystic Grill
[Pearl is talking to Anna in the restroom.]

Pearl: Jeremy Gilbert? Is that what you've been up to?
Anna: He's my friend. What's the big deal?
Pearl: His family is the reason I was stuck in a tomb for over a century.
Anna: That doesn't mean he'll make the same choices.
Pearl: I want you to stop seeing him.
Anna: I've been on my own for a long time, mother. I can make my own decisions.
Pearl: Then stop acting like a child! As soon as Jeremy finds out what you really are, he will turn on you.
Anna: He already knows.
Pearl: What did you just say?
Anna: Jeremy knows. He likes it. And he likes me.
[Pearl slaps her. When they are exiting the Grill, Anna she sends Jeremy a text saying I'll do it.]

Damon: She was supposed to stay in the car.
Stefan: Unh! No. No. No. Not him.

Damon: Elena, pull that.
Stefan: Unh!

Damon: Can you get him in the car?
Elena: Yeah.
Damon: All right, go.
Elena: What about you?
Damon: You rescue, I'll distract. Go.

Pearl: Trust me. The parties responsible for this will be dealt with.

[Stefan is on the floor, doing push-ups.]

Damon: Oh come on. Just drink already. Come on, this self-detox is not natural.

Stefan: Can you get that away from me please?
Damon: How long did it take you to wean yourself of it the last time you indulged?
[Stefan continues doing push ups.]

Damon: That's not good.
Stefan: I'll be fine; it just takes a little bit of time.
Damon: I don't get it; you know, you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for. I haven't hunted in a human in...God way too long.
Stefan: Oh, I'm impressed.
Damon: It's completely self-serving. I'm trying to get the town off the trail of vampires which is not very easy considering that there is an entire tomb of them running around.
Stefan: What are we planning on doing about that?
Damon: We are not going to do much of anything if you don't have your strength. There's nothing wrong with partaking in a healthy diet of human blood from a blood bank. You're not actually killing anyone.
Stefan: I have my reasons.
Damon: Well, what are those holier-than-thou reasons? You know, we never actually discussed this. You know, I'd- I'd love to hear this story.
[Damon sits down on the couch.]

Stefan: You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Watching me struggle?
Damon: Very much so.
Stefan: I hate to break it to you Damon but...I actually have it under complete control.
Damon: You do? Well, then you should just carry on, making the rest of us vampires look bad.
[He gets up.]

Damon: Have a great day, Stefan.
[He leaves the glass of blood on the table. Stefan stares at the glass. Damon returns.]

Damon: Oh, hey, almost forgot something. Oops.
[He takes the glass and leaves. He drinks and relishes in the taste of the blood.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is walking out of the house.]

Elena: Come on Jeremy, going to school! Walking out the door now!
Jenna: Forgot this. [She gives her a thermos.]
Elena: Thank you.
[She opens the door, John is here, he was about to knock.]

John [with a smile]: Elena!
Elena: Uncle John! Hi.
John [looking at Jenna]: Jenna.
Jenna: John, you made it.
John: I said I'll be here before noon.
[He enters the house.]

Jenna: Oh what you say and what you do are typically two very different things.
[Jeremy comes down the stairs.]

Jeremy: Uncle John, what's up?
John: Hey!
[Jeremy slaps him on the shoulder and leaves.]

John: I had some business in town; I thought that a visit was in order.
Elena: How long are you staying?
John: I don't know yet.
Elena: Okay, well, I'm gonna go to school, I'll see you later.
[She leaves; Jenna looks at her and closes the door.]

John: So what's up with Jeremy?
Jenna: He just lost a friend, so try to be sensitive.
John [laughing]: I'm always sensitive.
Jenna: Right, so really how long are you staying?
John: Can you at least pretend that you're happy to see me?
Jenna [joking]: Oh my god John! It's so good to see you. How have you been? [She becomes serious again.]: No, I can't.
John: Do you really think that I was just gonna sign the escrow papers and send them back?
Jenna: Actually I did.
John: I'm not going to let you sell my brother's office.
Jenna: It's not up to you or me; it belongs to Jeremy and Elena.
John: Yeah but they're minors, so I get the final say, being that I'm the estate's trustee.
Mystic Falls High School
[Matt and Elena are in the hallway.]

Elena: He said his trip is open ended.
Matt: Uncle John, I never really liked that guy.
Elena: Does anyone?
Matt: I'm here for moral support if you need me.
Elena: Thanks, I think I'll suffer this one alone; you've been through enough.
Matt: Thank you by the way, for just...for everything you did at Vicki's funeral and the memorial. I couldn't have done it without you.
Elena: Of course Matt.
[Long pause, they look at each other.]

Elena: So, was Caroline still baking for you guys, around the clock?
Matt: She finally went to her dad, which is a good thing because my mom was going to strangle her if she dropped off one more lasagna.
[He closes his locker and they leave.]

[Jeremy is outside, sitting on a couch, listening to music. Tyler arrives and sits down next to him. He offers him a joint.]

Jeremy: Nah.
Tyler: What's your problem?
Jeremy: I just don't want any.
Tyler: All right. They say she OD'd.
Jeremy: That's what I don't get, she was doing okay.
Tyler: Apparently not.
Jeremy: How did she end up buried in the woods? That's what I don't understand.
Tyler: By whoever was with her when she OD'd.
Jeremy: Yeah but you leave her, you don't take the time to bury her.
Tyler: Maybe she saw something and...Hell man, I don't know.
Founders' Hall
[Damon arrives and meets the rest of the council for a reunion.]

Sheriff Forbes: The coroner's office has officially ruled Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose. Her family has been notified, the truth will stay in this room and we can put this behind us.
Mayor Lockwood: Thank you Sheriff. And on to a more pressing issue, John Gilbert has asked to say a few words.
[Damon seems surprised.]

Mayor Lockwood: Welcome back John, it's good to see you.
John: Hello everyone, it's wonderful to see you, I wish it were under better circumstances. As a founding family member I find it's my duty to report some very distressing news.
[Damon speaking discretely to the Sheriff.]

Damon: He's a Gilbert?
Sheriff Forbes: Elena's uncle. His name is John but I call him Jackass.
John: A hospital blood bank in the neighboring county of Amherst has reported several break ins over the past two weeks. 7 hunters, 4 campers and 2 states employees have been reported missing as well. All of this within a 75-mile radius of Mystic Falls.
[Mayor Lockwood interrupts him.]

Mayor Lockwood: Okay okay, no need to get alarmed right at this moment.
Sheriff Forbes [To Damon]: Meaning he doesn't want to cancel the Founders' Day Kick-off Party.
John: You think all of your problems are over but I'm here to tell you, nothing's been solved.
[Damon seems uncomfortable.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric is in his classroom with Elena.]

Alaric: I made a copy of a paper Jeremy wrote for me. I think you should take a look at it.
[He gives the paper to Elena. She reads the title: Fact or Fiction: The Truth About Vampires in Mystic Falls.]

Elena: Jeremy wrote this?
Alaric: He's very clear that he didn't think it was real.
Elena: I really hope you're right because I've done so much to protect him from all of this.
[She gives him back the paper.]

Alaric: So, how do you deal with it?
Elena: What do you mean?
Alaric: With all the lies and the secrets. You have to lie to everyone who's important to you.
Elena: It's not safe for them to know the truth. So, yes I keep it from them, but it's only because I love them.
[Long pause.]

Alaric: I think Stefan is a good guy. But at the end of the day he's still a vampire.
Elena: I know it's hard to understand but Stefan is different. He would never do anything to hurt me.
Gilbert Residence
[John and Jeremy are eating in the kitchen. Jenna is here too.]

Jeremy: I've no interest in the Founders' Day Kick-off Party.
John: Sure you do its tradition.
Jenna: It will be our role to break the tradition.
John: The Gilberts have been a part of this town for a hundred and fifty years. We're one of the founding families and with that distinction comes certain obligations including going to the party. One day, when you can appreciate the significance, I'll tell you all about your heritage.
Jenna: Hmm, the Gilbert family legacy. I forgot how sacred it was. I'm not a Gilbert so I was never cool enough to hear it.
Jeremy [To John]: Why does she hate you?
John: We used to sleep together.
[Jenna throws a bag at him.]

Jenna: I'm standing right here.
[Elena is in her bedroom with Stefan.]

Elena: Why would he write a report on vampires? Do you think he's starting to remember?
Stefan: Damon took away those memories for good, you don't have to worry about that. I tell you what: why don't you just ask him?
Elena: I...I can't.
Stefan: Why not? I mean if he doesn't know anything then it's just an innocent question.
Elena: I don't even know how to talk to him anymore. I mean, we used to be a lot more open with each other. But now, with all these secrets just piling up...You know, I haven't even told him that I am adopted yet.
Stefan: Maybe it's time you start opening up to him. I'm not saying you should tell him everything but at least try to find out what he does know and be prepared for it.
[She rubs his shoulder.]

Elena: What about you, how are you doing?
Stefan: Much, much better. I'm still, you know...a little jittery, a little bit on edge but I'm gonna be okay.
Elena: I've been really worried about you and I missed you.
Stefan: I just needed to lay low for a little while and let my body readjust. It's only been a few days.
Elena: It feels like a lifetime.
[They kiss each other.]

Stefan: I've missed you too.
[They start kissing more passionately. Stefan lays Elena down on the bed. Elena rolls over and lays on top of Stefan. Stefan, somewhat aggressively, rolls her back over so he's on top. He stops kissing her. ]

Elena: Stefan, what's wrong? Stefan?
[His face starts transforming. He throws himself back against the wall, breaking a lamp in the process.]

[Someone knocks on the door. Elena opens it. It's Damon.]

Elena: Oh good you're here.
Damon: You ask I come. I'm easy like that.
[Elena points upstairs. Damon sees Jeremy eating in the kitchen.]

Damon [loud]: No Elena, I will not go to your bedroom with you.
[She catches his arm. He laughs and go upstairs with her. Jeremy looks at them. Elena and Damon enter her bedroom.]

Damon: Ah, just like I remember.
Elena: Stop messing around.
[He goes to her bed, takes the teddy bear off the pillow, lays on her bed and holds the teddy bear on his chest.]

Damon: Did you know that your uncle has been kicking it with the Founders' Council?
Elena: What?
Damon: Yep.
Elena: Perfect, we'll just add it to the growing list of how everything is falling apart.
[Damon notices the broken lamp and points an arm of the teddy bear towards it.]

Damon: What happened right there?
Elena: Uh...nothing.
[She seems uncomfortable. He looks at her.]

Elena: Look Damon, I'm worried about Stefan. He says that everything's okay but he's clearly struggling. How long is it gonna take before he goes back to normal?
Damon: A few days, give or take.
Elena: It's been a few days.
Damon: Give then, I don't know. What's the big deal?
[He gets up and gives her the teddy bear.]

Elena: He's not himself, Damon.
[Damon goes toward the dresser, opens the drawer and looks in it.]

Damon: Well, maybe his problem is that he has spent too long not being himself.
[He takes a bra from the drawer. Elena takes it from him and put it back in the drawer.]

Elena: Please don't make me sorry for asking you.
[He takes a picture from the mirror; she tries to take it back but is too slow.]

Damon: It is what it is Elena. The Stefan you know was good behavior Stefan, reign it in Stefan, fight against his nature into an annoying excessive level Stefan but if you think there isn't another part to this then you have not been paying attention.
[He pouts at Elena as if ready to kiss her, but instead Elena takes back the picture.]

Elena: He's not you, not even close.
Damon: Well, he doesn't want to be me. That doesn't mean that deep down though he's not.
[He gets closer to her, looks at her and leaves.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is looking for a book. He seems to be stressed. He roughly pours himself a glass of whiskey and drinks it.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is in his bedroom. Someone knocks on the door. It's Elena.]

Elena: Hey.
Jeremy: What's up?
Elena: Do you have some time to talk?
Jeremy: Uh, yeah, sure.
Elena: Not here. Come on. Let's get out of the house.
Lake
[Elena and Jeremy are walking.]

Jeremy: I just can't believe mom and dad never told you that you were adopted.
Elena: I'm sure they would have eventually.
Jeremy: Why were you worried about what I thought?
Elena: Because...I don't know. It's weird. Going you're whole life thinking you're related by blood to someone.
Jeremy: Does it bug you that we're not?
Elena: No, Jer...you're my brother, that's all that matters.
[He smiles.]

Elena: So, Mr. Saltzman said you've been doing great in history now.
Jeremy: Yeah, yeah he's really been helping me out. He gave me some extra credit and stuff.
Elena: He loved your vampire paper.
Jeremy: He thought I had a clever angle.
Elena: What drew you to that subject matter?
Jeremy: I don't know, boredom or maybe I'm just as nuts as the long line of Gilbert crazies.
Elena: Gilberts aren't crazy.
Jeremy: Easy for you to say, you're not one.
[She stops.]

Elena: Ouch.
[She hits him with her shoulder and runs after him.]

Founders' Hall
[Founders' Day 150 Year Anniversary Kick-off Party.]

[Stefan and Damon are arrive.]

Stefan: Oh god! I shouldn't be here.
Damon: Come on, don't be a downer, it's a party for the founding families! That would be us. That would be rude to skip it.
Stefan: I really liked you a whole lot better when you hated everybody.
Damon: Oh I still do. I just love that they love me.
[He laughs and looks at Stefan.]

Damon: How are you feeling?
Stefan: I'm good, I'm fine.
Damon: No cravings? No urges? Is that whiskey you've been drinking all day doing its job?
[Stefan laughs.]

Damon: We are who we are Stefan. Nothing's gonna change that.
Stefan: Ah! Nothing will make you happier to just see me given up hein Damon?
Damon: Whatever, it's inevitable.
Stefan: Well, I'm gonna find Elena.
[He leaves.]

Damon: Don't embarrass me young man!
[Stefan, while walking through the hall, smoothly takes a glass of whiskey, throws away the straw, drinks it, and sets the glass down.]

[Mayor Lockwood and Tyler are talking with Matt and Kelly.]

Mayor Lockwood: I'm so glad you could join us tonight.
Kelly: It was nice of you to reach out to us.
Mayor Lockwood: This town is one big family, when we lose a member we all have to come together.
[He takes their hands.]

Mayor Lockwood: Matt.
Matt: Mayor.
[Mayor Lockwood looks at his son and leaves, he leaves too.]

Kelly: Well I guess dead kid rates a special greeting from the mayor, huh?
Matt: God, mom!
Kelly: I need a drink.
[She leaves. Tyler arrives with a full bottle of bourbon whiskey.]

Tyler: Check it out!
Matt: Your dad is going to beat you down if he catches you.
Tyler: Yeah. Let him try.
Matt: Screw it.
[He takes the bottle and drinks.]

[Stefan is at the bar drinking. Elena arrives. He sees her, puts the glass on the bar and waves to her.]

Elena: Hey!
Stefan: Hey. How are you?
[He kisses her on the cheek.]

Elena: Are you drunk?
Stefan: Okay, I know it's a little weird but it's really helping me. The alcohol takes the edge off.
Elena: You're totally that drunk high school guy at parties sneaking booze.
Stefan: I totally am, yeah.
Elena: How worried do I need to be?
Stefan: Oh no! You don't need to be worried. It's just until the cravings go away. Listen, I think we should enjoy it while it lasts. Would you like to dance with me?
Elena: You hate dancing. I usually have to beg you.
Stefan: No, no, no you have to beg the sober me. The drunk me there is no begging necessary.
[She looks at the dance floor.]

Elena: There's really no one dancing.
Stefan: That's because they need something better to dance to. I'll be right back.
[He leaves and Kelly arrives.]

Kelly: Yeah...That's not gonna work. I already tried to bribe the guy with 20 bucks and a date. He said Carol Lockwood has complete control over the music choices.
[Elena looks at Stefan. He is compelling the DJ.]

Elena: You'd be surprised what Stefan can accomplish when he puts his mind to it.
[The music changes.]

Kelly: Thank God!
[Kelly is dancing with Stefan. Damon rejoins Elena at the bar and looks at Stefan.]

Damon: Have I entered an alternate universe where Stefan is fun?
Elena: Is he gonna be okay?
Damon: Eventually. One way or another.
[They look at each other, and then they watch Stefan. Damon smiles.]

[Elena and Jenna are laughing together. Elena sees Alaric.]

Elena: History teacher three o'clock.
Jenna: How do I look?
Elena: Beautiful.
[Alaric rejoins them.]

Alaric [to Jenna]: I was looking for you.
Jenna: Here I am. I haven't seen you in a while.
Alaric: Well uh...[He looks at Elena] Things have been a little crazy but I'm here now. Do you want to get a drink?
Jenna: Sure.
Alaric: Okay.
[They look at Elena and leave. Matt arrives.]

Matt: When did this happen?
Elena: DJ had a change of heart.
Matt: Do you want to dance?
Elena: I don't know.
Matt: Yes.
Elena: Matt!
[He catches her waist and makes her dance.]

[Damon is walks to another part of the hall and rejoins the Sheriff.]

Damon: You know I love a woman in uniform but I have to side with this one. You look...you look smashing.
[She laughs.]

Sheriff Forbes: Thank you Damon. Cheers! [They clink glasses.] I needed that. You know I had my doubts about you at first but like everyone else on the council you've won me over.
Damon: Thanks Liz. It's really nice how welcoming the council has been. I like my life here in Mystic Falls. Starting to feel like home again.
Sheriff Forbes: Well, you're not gonna like what I have to tell you. Johnathan Gilbert's claims check out. Blood bank, the missing people, all of it's true. We might have a problem.
[Jeremy arrives and interrupts them.]

Jeremy: Excuse me Sheriff. I was curious if there's been any more information about what happened to Vicki Donovan?
Sheriff Forbes: It was an overdose, Jeremy.
Jeremy: Yeah, but her body was buried. Somebody must have done that.
[Damon is really uncomfortable.]

Sheriff Forbes: We're aware of that. The investigation is ongoing but there's nothing more I can tell you at this time. I'm sorry.
Jeremy: It's okay.
[Elena and Matt are dancing. He leaves. Elena falls into Stefan.]

Stefan: Please dance with your alcoholic vampire boyfriend.
[They dance and Elena accidentally runs into a man.]

Man: Wow! Watch it!
Elena: I'm sorry, my fault. I'm clumsy.
Man: Then get off the dance floor.
Elena: Excuse me?
Stefan: That no way to talk to a lady.
Man: Whatever.
[He turns to leave but Stefan catches his arm and compels him.]

Stefan: I think you need to apologize.
Man: I'm sorry.
[He starts to leave, but Stefan grabs him again.]

Stefan: Now say it like you mean it.
Man: I'm really, really sorry.
Elena: Stefan, it's fine.
Stefan: Now walk away.
[He pushes him. The man leaves. Elena touches Stefan's arm.]

Stefan: [He touches Elena's face.] You alright?
[Elena nods.]

[Damon is at the bar. Elena joins him.]

Elena: Have you noticed what your brother has been up to?
Damon: No, I have been too preoccupied with yours.
[She looks at him.]

Damon: Jeremy has been asking questions about Vicki Donovan's death.
Elena: He knows that her death was ruled an overdose.
Damon: Really? [Imitating Jeremy.] Oh but sheriff, someone buried her. Who would do that? I know I know! Me! I mean I could compel him but he's wearing vervain.
Elena: No, I don't want you to compel him.
Damon: If he keeps asking questions...
Elena: Damon, no I'm serious. I'm not going to do that to him again. I'll handle it.
[Damon takes a rose, smells it, and gives it to her.]

Damon: Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you.
[She takes the rose, they look at each other and he leaves.]

[Kelly finishes her drink and puts the glass in a plant. Tyler looks at her.]

Tyler: I saw that.
Kelly: Shh! We'll keep that between you and me. Where is the ladies' room?
Tyler: This way, I'll show you.
Kelly [seeing his glass]: Is that soda?
Tyler: Um...
[She takes his glass and drinks.]

Kelly: Vodka. Thank god!
[Damon is on the balcony. John joins him.]

John: Damon, right?
Damon: John.
John: We didn't get the chance to meet at the council meeting.
Damon: Yeah. It's a pleasure. Are you enjoying the kick-off?
John: Oh yeah. I forgot how much fun these small town celebrations can be.
Damon: Yeah. When was the last time you were here?
John: Hasn't been that long, my brother's funeral. How long have you been in town?
Damon: Oh, not long at all.
John: So what do you think Damon? You know this vampire problem is real, right? It's a potential blood bath.
Damon: I wouldn't overreact John.
John: Oh, I think it's like 1864 all over again, vampires running amok. I guess we're just gonna have to hunt them down, throw them in a church and burn them to ash.
Damon: That's the story, huh?
John: Part of the story, yeah.
Damon: Oh, there's more?
John: Oh, there's a lot more. See, it seems there was a tomb under the church, where vampires were hidden, waiting for someone to come along and set them free. But then you already knew that didn't you?
[Damon doesn't look at him. He's uncomfortable.]

John: I mean, you're the one that did it.
Damon: And you're telling me this why?
John: I just thought we get the introductions out of the way.
Damon: You know that I could rip your throat out before anyone would notice?
John: Yeah.
Damon: Yeah, okay. But you probably ingest vervain so...
John: Why don't you take a bite to find out?
Damon [smiling]: It's not worth my time.
[They look at each other and smile. Damon starts to leave but he rushes towards John, breaks his neck, and throws him off the balcony.]

[Jeremy is sitting on a couch in a quiet, dimly-lit room. Elena rejoins him.]

Elena: Jer? I heard about your conversation with Sheriff Forbes.
Jeremy: No one is trying to figure out what happened to her. They all want to believe that she OD'd.
Elena: The coroner's office confirmed it. If that's what they said happened then...
Jeremy: Is that what you believe?
Elena: What do you think happened?
Jeremy: I think somebody killed her and buried her body and I don't think we should write it off just cause it's easy.
Elena: They're just doing what they can to move on.
Jeremy: The truth is the only thing that's gonna help people to move on.
Elena: Jer, just let it go, okay? Whatever it was she's gone now.
Jeremy: Whatever it was? So you don't think it was an overdose?
Elena: Yes...I do.
Jeremy: Is there something you're not telling me?
[Elena is really uncomfortable.]

Jeremy: Why aren't you looking at me?
Elena: Stop it, that doesn't mean anything.
Jeremy: If there was something else you would tell me, right?
[Long pause.]

Elena: Of course I would.
[Jeremy looks at her, suspicious.]

[Kelly and Tyler are outside. They laugh and are a little bit drunk.]

Kelly: Oh god! I can't even walk.
Tyler: I know, me neither.
Kelly: Oh my god, Matt is going to kill me.
Tyler: He won't even notice. I think he's actually letting himself have some fun for once.
Kelly: Yeah, I know I just should be on my best behavior because of Vicki but I don't want to think about it. I can't, because if I do...
Tyler: Yeah, I was a dick to her, I was really bad. That's what I hate is I can't make any of it right. It's like I don't deserve to even miss her.
[Kelly touches him.]

Kelly: You're nice to talk to me. I don't have anyone to talk to.
[Long pause during which they are looking each other.]

Tyler: I don't have anyone to talk to either.
[She leans a little closer and smiles.]

[Elena is walking through the hallway and Matt comes up to her.]

Matt: Who knew I've been missing all the fun at the Founders' parties?
Elena: This is rare, believe me.
Matt: Is it bad that I'm enjoying myself?
Elena: No, it's great that you are enjoying yourself. Thanks for making me dance.
Matt: Hey, it's normal.
[They embrace each other.]

Matt: Air, I need some air. Come with me?
[Elena looks at Stefan. He's drinking.]

Elena: Sure.
Matt: You haven't seen my mom have you?
Elena: No, not in a while.
[She looks at Stefan again. They go out. Elena sees Kelly and Tyler.]

Elena: Oh my god.
[Kelly and Tyler are kissing. Matt rushes over to them and catches Tyler.]

Matt: What the hell are you doing man?
Kelly: Matt?!
Matt [screaming]: Mom!!!!
Tyler: Whoa dude calm down.
[Matt punches Tyler in the face. They begin to fight and in the fight Kelly gets pushed to the floor. Tyler hits Matt again and again and again.]

Elena: Matt! Stop it! Tyler! Stop it, you're hurting him! Somebody help us.
[Alaric arrives, pulls Tyler off Matt and pushes him against a wall.]

Alaric: What the hell is that?
[Elena is going toward Matt. The Mayor arrives.]

Mayor Lockwood: I'll take it from here; I'll take it from here [To Tyler]: Are you hurt? Go get cleaned up. It's okay. Go get cleaned up.
[Tyler leaves.]

Mayor Lockwood [to Alaric]: Thank you for your help.
[Elena helps Matt.]

Mayor Lockwood [to the guests]: Everything's fine. Everything is fine. Come on, everybody, back to the party. Let's go. Come on, have a good time!
[Elena is with Matt, he is bleeding a lot.]

Elena: Are you okay?
Matt: Where is she?
Elena: I don't know. Put your head up.
[She looks at his face.]

[Stefan is still drinking, Damon arrives.]

Damon: You wanna hear the bad news or the really bad news?
Stefan: Actually, I don't want any news Damon.
Damon: Alright, let me rephrase. Do you want to hear how the council is back in vampire mode or how I just killed Uncle John Gilbert?
Stefan: What?
Damon: Great party by the way, huh?
[He smiles and leaves. Stefan goes after him.]

Stefan: Damon.
[Stefan suddenly stops. He sees Kelly crying and bleeding. He approaches her.]

Stefan: Is everything alright?
Kelly: No. I ruined it, I always ruin it. What is wrong with me?
[Stefan slowly kneels down to her eye level and stares at the blood coming out of Kelly's forehead. He touches the blood on her forehead.]

Kelly: What are you doing?
[He finally comes around.]

Stefan: Uh, I'm sorry.
[He gets up and leaves. Outside, he looks down at his hand with the blood on it, walks to a fence and leans on it. He licks the blood off of his finger.]

[Damon is inside. Suddenly he sees John Gilbert entering.]

Damon: You got to be kidding me.
[Later, Mayor Lockwood is talking to the crowd.]

Mayor Lockwood: Thank you all, thank you very much, thank you. Thank you all for joining us tonight in just a few moments we will officially begin the countdown to our upcoming Founders' Day celebration and it's a very special one this year. The one hundred and fiftieth birthday of our town.
[A bell on a table is wheeled next to him.]

Mayor Lockwood: And...and I would like to welcome back one of our town favorite's sons to do the honors of ringing our official charter bell. John Gilbert, would you please join me up here?
[John Gilbert applause and rejoins the mayor. Damon is looking at him.]

John: One hundred and fifty years of community, prosperity, family. We take care of each other, we look after each other, protect each other [He looks at Damon.] It's good to be home.
[Everyone applauds, Damon rejoins Alaric.]

Damon: Look at his right hand.
Alaric: Whose?
Damon: Towns favorite's son. Look at his ring.
[John rings the bell and it can be seen that he wears the same ring that Alaric wears.]

Alaric: Well, it looks like mine.
Damon: Yeah, and that would be a big coincidence if he didn't just came back from the dead five minutes ago. Where the hell did you get that ring?
Alaric: Isobel, my wife.
Damon: Who gave birth to Elena, under the medical care of the esteemed DR Grayson Gilbert, John's brother!
[They look at John.]

Alaric: Do you think John knew Isobel?
Damon: I think John knows a lot of things.
[Stefan is in the parking lot. He leaves but he falls into the man he compelled earlier. The man pushes him.]

Man: Sorry about that man. I really am terribly sorry.
Stefan: You don't want to do this man.
[The man pushes him again.]

Man: I'm sorry about that too. All I can do is apologize. What's that about?
Stefan: Get out of my way. Please.
Man: No girl to show off for now? I see what how this is.
[He tries to punch Stefan but Stefan catches mid-flight, crushes it slowly, and pushes the man on the floor. His face changes.]

Man: What are you, man?
Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy goes up the stairs and goes into Elena's bedroom, he looks everywhere but he doesn't find what he is looking for. He finally looks behind the painting and find Elena's diary. He begins to read it. One page contains But how can I deny it? and Bodies drained of blood. Another page contains Take away Jeremy's pain... and another ...that Vicki was a monster?]

Founders' Hall
[Stefan is above the man, looking at him. The man is on the floor, unconscious. He leaves at vamp-speed when he hears Elena.]

Elena: Stefan? Stefan? [She sees the man on the ground and runs over to him.] Hey! Are you okay? What happened?
[The man gets up.]

Man: My arm. I lost my balance and fell. I'm clumsy.
[Tyler is alone when the Mayor arrives.]

Mayor Lockwood: Let's go.
Tyler: Dad, I'm sorry. I don't even know what happened. I was drinking and...I lost control. I can't explain it.
[The mayor slaps him in the face.]

Mayor Lockwood: That is the last time you ever embarrass this family.
Donovan Residence
[Matt is packing his mother's suitcase. Kelly arrives.]

Kelly: What are you doing? Matt don't.
Matt: I can't do it anymore mom so just go alright? You've done it before. More times than I can count.
Kelly: I'm not leaving you. Matty!
Matt [screaming]: Mom!!! Don't you get it? I'm better off without you.
[She cries.]

Kelly: No, tonight was...God, I'm so sorry. I know I failed you and I failed Vicki but I won't do it to you again. I promise I'll get it together.
Matt: I want you out of the house and my life by morning.
[Matt leaves. Kelly is crying.]

Founders' Hall
[John is leaving. Damon and Alaric follow him.]

Damon: Going somewhere, hm?
John: I've never liked to be the last one to leave a party. It's too desperate. You're going to kill me again or you're gonna let Mr. Saltzman do your dirty work?
Alaric: Okay, you obviously know who I am.
John: I do. Alaric Saltzman, a high school history teacher with a secret.
Damon: Sure know a lot for someone who just got to town.
John: More than you can imagine, Damon. My knowledge of this town goes beyond anything that you [He looks at Damon] or you [He looks at Alaric] or the council knows. So, if you're planning on some clever high speed snatch ring vamp kill move, know that if I die, everything I know goes to the council including the fascinating little tale of the originals Salvatore brothers and their present day return to Mystic Falls.
[Damon is surprised and doesn't know what to say.]

Alaric: How did you get that ring?
John: I had inherited one, my brother Gray had the other. This was his [He shows his ring to them] and I wouldn't have given mine to Isobel if I had known she'd hand it over to another guy.
Damon: So you did know her?
John: Who do you think send her your way when she wanted to become a vampire?
Damon: You sent her?
John: Guilty. Why, did you think someone else send her? Maybe Katherine Pierce?
Damon: How do you know about Katherine?
John: How do I know anything Damon?
Damon: What do you want?
John: So many questions. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ric. I've heard so much about you.
[John leaves. Damon and Alaric look at each other and watch him.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jenna and Elena are walking up the stairs.]

Jenna: Not so excited that we have another month of these Founders' Day events.
Elena: Tell me about it.
[She goes into Jeremy's bedroom.]

Elena: Are you okay?
Jeremy: Fine.
Elena: Are you sure?
Jeremy: I'm fine Elena.
[She leaves and goes into her bedroom. Stefan is there.]

Elena: Oh my god you scared me!
Stefan: Sorry. I'm sorry that I ran off earlier.
Elena: What happened? Is everything okay?
Stefan: Uh, no.
Elena: Talk to me.
[She closes the bathroom door and rejoins Stefan.]

Elena: Stefan, tell me.
Stefan: I tried so hard to keep it together tonight and it was working, it was working but then Matt's mom, she got hurt and she was bleeding and I had her blood on my hands.
Elena: And then what happened?
Stefan: And then that guy in the parking lot, I wanted to feed on him and it took everything inside of me not to do it.
Elena: But you didn't?
Stefan: No, but I wanted to. Elena, my head is pounding. I feel like my skin is on fire. I have this hunger inside of me that I've never felt before in my entire life and all I keep thinking about is how I promised that I would never keep anything from you, and so I'm telling you this.
Elena: That's okay; I need you to tell me these things.
Stefan: But I don't want you to see me like this, I don't want you to know that this side of me exists.
Elena: Stefan, you're gonna get through this. I'm gonna help you pull through. It's gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay.
[She takes his face between her hands but he rejects her and gets up.]

Stefan: No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, I can't, I'm afraid of what I could do to you.
Elena: I'm not.
[She goes towards him and takes again his face between her hands.]

Elena: Stefan, I'm not.
[She looks into his eyes and kisses him.]

Elena: I'm not, okay?
[They embrace each other.]

Stefan: I love you so much.
Elena: I love you too.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is on the couch, in front of the fire, a glass of blood in his hand. Stefan arrives.]

Damon: We have a problem Stefan and when I say problem I mean global crisis. It seems Uncle John has...
[He looks at Stefan, he's not okay.]

Damon: You don't look so good. Its different this time, isn't it? The need is too strong. Of course it would be after all these years.
[He puts the glass of blood on the table, looks at Stefan and gets up. He touches his shoulder and looks at him.]

Damon: Have a good night brother.
[He leaves. Stefan looks at the glass; he takes it and drinks the blood.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Stefan is parking his car. Elena sees him and joins him.]

Elena: Nice car.
Stefan: Thought it was a waste to leave it in the garage.
[She smiles, they kiss.]

Elena: I didn't know you were coming back today.
Stefan: You know, I woke up this morning and I was feeling great and I figured it was time for me to get back into things.
Elena: Does that mean you're okay now, with all the cravings?
Stefan: Yeah, I mean the worst part is over so...now all I want to do is just spend as much time with you as possible.
Elena: I'm okay with that.
[They kiss.]

Stefan: Hey, thank you for helping me get through the rough patch.
Elena: You're welcome [pause, they look each other]. We're gonna be late.
Stefan: Okay, uh, you know what? I'll catch up with you, I'm gonna grab my stuff. I'll be right behind you.
Elena: Okay.
[She leaves; he goes to the trunk and opens it. There are a lot of blood bags from Mystic Falls Hospital. He grabs his stuff and closes the trunk.]

Founders Hall
[Damon, John and Sheriff Forbes are talking.]

Sheriff Forbes: There was a disturbance at the hospital blood bank last night; some of the supply was compromised.
Damon: Compromised? You mean stolen?
Sheriff Forbes: We almost missed it. The inventory records were altered but when the night manager was questioned he had no recollection of changing them.
John: Meaning that the vampire who stole the blood used mind control to hide the theft.
Damon [looking at John]: I know what you meant.
Sheriff Forbes: We wouldn't have noticed had John not alerted us to recent discrepancies in other hospital blood banks in the county.
Damon: How lucky for us, we have John.
[He looks at John.]

Sheriff Forbes: We're stepping up security at the hospital, giving the guard vervain to prevent this from happening again.
John: Sheriff, may I offer a suggestion? Why don't Damon and I put our heads together? We can track down whoever is doing this.
Sheriff Forbes: Truthfully I can use the extra hands. Is that something you would be willing to do?
Damon: Well, of course, I mean if it'll help.
John: I think we could make a good team, don't you think Damon?
[He looks at Damon.]

Damon: John, whatever I can do to help keep this town safe; even if it means spending time with you.
[He looks at John and smiles, John smiles too.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric's History Class.]

Alaric: Okay, this week we're gonna set outside our regular curriculum for a lesson in local history as we approach Founders' Day. Apparently the community leaders feels it's more important than World War 2 but hey what do I know?
[Bonnie interrupts him and enters the classroom.]

Bonnie: Sorry I'm late.
Alaric: Well, it looks like we will be at full occupancy today. Welcome home, Bonnie.
[Bonnie sits down and smiles at Elena but when she looks at Stefan her smile fades and. Stefan smiles at her but she tries not to look and him and turns her head. Elena and Stefan don't understand, they look at each other.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Someone is ringing the bell, Damon opens the door: it's Anna.]

Damon: I suppose I should be grateful, you learned how to use the bell.
Anna: I'm here on behalf of my mother.
[She enters.]

Damon: On behalf of or in spite of?
Anna: I'm sorry about what the other vampires did to Stefan. Abducting him, torturing him...It wasn't supposed to go down like that.
Damon: You're playing house with half of a tomb of really pissed off vampires. What do you think was going to happen?
Anna: My mom is devastated; they tried to over throw her.
Damon: Why isn't she here telling me this?
Anna: She doesn't really do apologies.
Damon: Well, it's a coincidence, cause I don't do forgiveness. Just run along. And if you're going continue playing house with these little vampires pets, you might wanna stop robbing the blood bank dry because they're onto it.
Anna: I haven't been to the local blood bank in at least a week.
Damon: Then it's one of your others.
Anna: The others are gone, Damon.
Damon: Well, where did they go?
Anna: They weren't cut out for this town. After what happened with your brother my mom kicked them out and they took off. It's just us and Harper now.
Mystic Falls High School
[Bonnie is walking, reading papers; Elena is running after her.]

Elena: Bonnie!
Bonnie: Hey.
Elena: Hey, I tried to grab you after class but you already taken off. How are you? How's your family?
Bonnie: We're dealing, it's been hard.
Elena: Everyone here really missed you.
Bonnie: Yeah, I just had so much to deal with after Grams' funeral and, honestly after you told me the tomb spell failed I just didn't really want to come back.
Elena: I hope that you understand why I called...I wanted you to know before you came home.
Bonnie: I understand why. I just...shouldn't know.
[Long pause, they look at each other.]

Elena: I know it's been really hard...
[Caroline interrupts them.]

Caroline: Bonnie! Bonnie! Thank god you're home!
[She embraces Bonnie.]

Caroline: I know we talked everyday but I missed you.
[Elena seems upset.]

Caroline: How are you doing?
Bonnie: Better. Better. You know, glad to be back and trying to keep myself busy.
Caroline: Well, I can help with that. Major wardrobe problem. You need to help me pick up the perfect dress for the Founders' court.
Elena: The Founders' court? Did I miss something?
Caroline: The Founders' court! You know, Miss Mystic Falls. They announced it today and you and I are both on it.
Elena: Oh my god! We signed up for that so long ago...I completely forgot.
Caroline: So, are you dropping out then?
Elena: I can't.
[She looks at Bonnie.]

Caroline: No?
Bonnie: Her mom is the one who wanted her to enter.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is back from school. Damon walks up to him.]

Damon: How was school?
Stefan: Fine.
Damon: Yeah? Same old, same old? Nothing new? No stories to bring home?
Stefan: You're making small talk, why?
Damon: You seem awfully chipper lately, less doom and gloom, a little more pep in your step.
Stefan: And you think it's because I drank human blood again.
Damon: I don't want to brag but I would definitely take responsibility for this new and improved you.
Stefan: Well, I hate to burst your bubble but I'm clean.
Damon: Yeah, not possible.
Stefan: Not only isn't possible but it is quite true.
Damon: Stefan, just be serious for a second. You spent the last century and a half being a poster child for Prozac and now you expect me to believe that this new you has nothing to do with human blood. Nothing.
Stefan: I'm clean.
Damon: You're lying!
Stefan: Believe what you want.
[Stefan leaves, Damon seems suspicious.]

Gilbert Residence and Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena is in the kitchen. She opens the fridge and takes a bottle of water. She's on the phone with Stefan.]

Elena: I'm sorry for the short notice; I didn't even know that the contest was coming up much less that I would be in it.
Stefan: I will be happy to escort you anyway.
Elena: My mom was really into this Founders' day stuff. She was even Miss Mystic in her day. I kind of want to do it for her.
Stefan: It'll be great, we'll have fun.
Elena: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow, I love you.
Stefan: I love you too.
Salvatore Boarding House
[He hangs up. He has a blood pouch in his hands. He opens a drawer and hides the blood pouch in it. He goes in the basement and opens the fridge. There are a lot of blood pouches in it, he looks at it but Damon is looking at him in the shadow.]

Damon: Well well, he's a liar and a thief. So, when were you gonna share?
Stefan: Go ahead, help yourself.
Damon: No, no, no I'm talking about the fact that you're a closet blood junkie.
Stefan: So, I'm drinking blood again. You're the one that shoved it on me, what's your problem? I have it under control.
Damon: Under control? You robbed the hospital!
Stefan: So, what's your point?
Damon: Fine, whatever man, drink up. Just remember, we're trying to keep a low profile. Why don't you just walk up to Sheriff Forbes and ask her to tap a vein?
Stefan: Have my actions negatively impacted you? I can't imagine what that must feel like.
Damon: Yeah, what's Elena thinks about the new...you?
Stefan: Nothing's changed; I'm still the same person.
Damon: Clearly.
Stefan: Elena doesn't need to know anything yet.
Damon: You've been off the human stuff for years, Stefan. If you're having trouble controlling...
Stefan: I'm not having trouble.
Damon: Who do you think you're talking to? I know what it's like. That Jekyll and Hyde feeling, that switch, sometimes it goes off and you snap. Right now is not a good time for me to be worried about you snapping.
Stefan: I know that it pains you to see this but I'm fine, okay? I'm fine.
[He takes a pouch from the fridge.]

Stefan: So please, do me a favor and back off.
[He closes the fridge and leaves.]

Founders Hall
[Carol Lockwood and two others woman are interviewing the girls who are in the Miss Mystic Falls pageant.]

Carol: This year's queen will have the special honor of taking stage at the hundred and fiftieth Founders' Day Gala. Before we crown our winner, we'd like to get to know a bit more about each of you.
[The contestants speak in an inter-cut edit.]

Caroline: I'm on the Mystic Falls beautification committee; I volunteer at the poor soup kitchen.
Elena: I recognize that I haven't been as involved this year that I used to be.
Caroline: I implemented this year's go green campaign at school.
Elena: I've been distracted and I let a lot of things slide.
Girl: I don't think it's wrong for me to win two years in a row.
Amber: I was surprised to have been selected since I'm not from one of the founding families.
Elena: But I'm aware of what an honor this is and I want you to know that I take it seriously.
Caroline: I worked for the recycling program and was in charge of this year's police raffle.
Tina: Just because my D.U.I. made my community service mandatory doesn't mean that I was any less committed.
Elena: This was really important to my mother. She believed in community, family, honor and loyalty. It's the legacy she left for me.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Someone is ringing the bell, Damon opens the door it's John. He enters in the house.]

John: Hey partner!
Damon: What do you want?
John: You haven't return any of my calls.
Damon: Most people take that as a hint.
John: Where do we start looking for vampires?
Damon: How do you act John? You obviously don't care about catching vampires, you're here talking to me.
John: Actually, I care very much.
Damon: What Isobel say about that? I mean, considering that she is one.
John: Isobel and I share a mutual interest. The original Jonathan Gilbert has an invention that was stolen by a vampire. That vampire was then burned alive in Fell's church, or so Jonathan thought and the invention was lost forever. But then the vampires weren't killed, were they? They were trapped and now they're free, thanks to you which means the invention is retrieval.
Damon: What is it?
John: The only thing that matters is that I want it back and you're going to help me if you want your secret safe.
Damon: Why bring me into it John? I mean, I don't know what you are talking about much less who has it.
John: Oh come on Damon! You were around back then, you know who these people are, what they look like. He was friendly with a woman who turned out to be a vampire. Her name was Pearl. Does that ring a bell?
[Long pause, they look at each other.]

Damon: I'm not playing anymore. Get out. Get out.
John: I beg your pardon?
Damon: You know, I only entertain this whole blackmail scheme thing of yours because I thought that you and Isobel could lead me to Katherine but see, now I know you've no idea where Katherine is, because if you did you would know that Katherine and Pearl were best friends. See, you don't know everything, do you John?
John: I'll tell the entire council what you are.
Damon: Go for it! I'll kill every last one of them. Then I'll sever your hand, pull your ring off, and I'll kill you too. Do you understand that?
Mystic Falls High School
[Carol Lockwood is teaching dance moves to the girls who are in the Mystic Falls pageant and their partners.]

Carol: Honor your partner. Stay focus, right hand around. Flirt with your eyes [Elena and Stefan are laughing] Left hand around.
Elena: This is ridiculous.
Carol: Both hands.
Stefan: You're only saying that because you don't know how to do it.
Elena: Sorry. Only one of us was around when the dance was invented.
Stefan: Ouch!
[Stefan spins Elena around and catches her in his arms.]

Elena: Woah!
Mrs Lockwood: No! No! There's no touching during this part. It's about the simple intimacy of the near touch. Very nice, Amber!
Amber: Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood!
Stefan: If you ask me, the 'near touch' is overrated.
Elena: You seem to be in a good mood.
Stefan: Is that a bad thing? Would you prefer me to be brooding and tortured?
Elena: Hey, I'm not complaining.
[Elena moves closer towards him.]

Stefan: Oh, no touching!
[Elena and Stefan go back to dancing.]

[Meanwhile, Caroline is in the hallway with Bonnie.]

Caroline: The Fell cousins don't have a shot and Amber Bradley is only on the court so the pageant doesn't look like its founding families only, which of course it is. So that leaves Elena which totally has the sympathy vote since her parents died. How can I compete with that?
Bonnie: Very nice, very sensitive.
Caroline: Oh I'm sorry, this must sound really unimportant. In light of everything.
Bonnie: It's okay, I get it, you want to win.
Caroline: Well, my grandmother was Miss Mystic and both of my aunts. My mom is the only one who didn't get the gene and I want this. I actually deserve this.
[They enter the room where the dancing is occurring, Bonnie sees Elena and Stefan leaving.]

Elena: Bonnie. Hey.
Stefan: Hey, how are you?
[She doesn't answer, Elena and Stefan feel that there's a problem.]

Caroline: I begged Bonnie to fill in for Matt, he had to work today.
[Elena looks at Bonnie.]

Elena: Bonnie, do you have a minute?
Bonnie: We only have 30 minutes for rehearsal.
Elena: It'll only take a minute, please?
[They walk out of the room.]

Elena: Bonnie, you have to tell me what's wrong.
Bonnie: It not worth talking about.
Elena: What do you mean not worth it? You barely said ten words to me and you won't even look at Stefan. Is that what it is? Is it Stefan?
Bonnie: Listen, Elena, I can't just pretend that everything's okay. Everything my Grams did was to protect us from those vampires in the tomb. And now they're out which means she died for nothing.
Elena: I'm so sorry Bonnie. What can I do to make it better?
Bonnie: That's just did, there's nothing you can do. I blame him, Elena, him and Damon and I'm not gonna put you in a situation where you have to choose sides. I'm just having a hard time with it, okay?
[Stefan is listening to them.]

[Stefan is walking across the campus. He gets to the basketball court. One of the players has injured himself and is bleeding. Stefan tenses up and can't turn away from the scene. Alaric touches his shoulder. Stefan strangles Alaric. He realizes who it is and let's go. ]

Alaric: Stefan! Are you okay?
Stefan: Yes, I'm sorry. I was just...I was feeling a little sick.
[He leaves, Alaric watches him.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena goes down the stairs; she has her dress in her arms. Someone knocks at the door. It's Alaric.]

Elena: Hey.
Alaric: Hi.
Elena: I heard you're driving.
Alaric: Yeah I am. Let me get that for you.
[He takes the dress.]

Elena: Thanks.
[He enters the house and closes the door.]

Alaric: How...how is Stefan?
Elena: What do you mean?
Alaric: You know, he seems on edge.
Elena: He went through a lot, he was in bad shape for a while but he's bouncing back now.
[They look at each other, John arrives.]

John: Alaric. Hey buddy, what are you doing here?
Alaric: I'm the chauffeur.
John: I thought I was driving.
[Jenna goes down the stairs.]

Jenna: No need, we're going with Rick.
Elena: Are we ready?
Jenna: Jeremy can ride with you.
Founders Hall
[Anna arrives, she goes outside. Damon rejoins her.]

Damon: In the running for Miss Mystic Falls?
Anna: Sometimes you have to wear uncomfortable heels to blend in. I remember this event from 1864, I was supposed to enter before everything happened.
Damon: Ah, nostalgia's a bitch.
Anna: If you're just gonna mock me can you move along please?
Damon: John Gilbert thinks your mom stole an artifact from Jonathan senior back in 1864.
Anna: What are you, his errand boy?
Damon: I don't know what it is but I don't want him to have it.
Anna: I could ask her but you know, you've made it pretty clear that you don't trust us so why should I even bother?
Damon: Because you want to stay in Mystic Falls and John Gilbert's in town, making that impossible. Find out where it is. He leaves, you can buy a welcome mat.
[The girls are putting their make up on. Jenna is curling Elena's hair.]

Elena: Thanks for helping me.
Jenna: Don't thank me until you're sure your hair isn't gonna burn off.
Elena: You know I remember when my mom and I were first applying for this, she was so excited.
Jenna: So were you if I recall.
Elena: I was. She just made it sound like so much fun. Lots has changed since then.
Jenna: I hate to break it to you, but its a little late for cold feet.
Elena: I don't have cold feet. I just...I think I'd be enjoying it a lot more if she was here.
Jenna: Well I tell you one thing, your hair would have a better chance if she was.
Elena: Okay, I should go put my dress on. Be careful with that thing, don't hurt anybody.
[She gets up and leaves, Caroline looks at her, she seems sad.]

[Jeremy is outside, alone, John joins him.]

John: You look miserable.
Jeremy: Are there really a whole month of these events that I'm supposed to show up at?
John: You could fight it if you want but it's part of being a Gilbert.
Jeremy: Yeah, you mentioned you know a lot about the family. You know anything about our ancestor Jonathan Gilbert?
John: Prolific writer, crazy inventor. Why do you ask?
Jeremy: Well, I read his journal.
John: Is that right?
Jeremy: Yeah, I actually found it in all dads' stuff.
John: Well, it's surprising. Most of them are locked away.
Jeremy: There are more of them?
John: Jonathan Gilbert journaled his whole life. Right down to the bitter, insane, drunken end. He had a lot of demons.
Jeremy: And did you read them?
John: I've browsed, yeah.
Jeremy: What did you think about what he wrote?
John: Crazy ramblings of a mad man, of course.
[He turns his head and sees Anna, he looks at her.]

John: She's very pretty.
[She looks at him and leaves.]

Jeremy: Yeah, uh, she's a friend of mine. Excuse me.
[He leaves.]

[Elena enters a room to put her dress on. Amber is already here, she's nervous.]

Elena: Are you okay, Amber?
Amber: I hate being the center of attention. I get panic attacks.
Elena: Do you need some privacy so you can change?
Amber: Actually I'm just- I'm gonna go get some air.
[She leaves and closes the door. Elena takes her dress, she sees Damon in the mirror.]

Elena: Hey, you can't be back here.
Damon: We need to talk.
Elena: Does it have to be right now?
Damon: Normally I would have a completely different outlook of what I'm about to tell you but since it could really inconvenience me, I'll squeal.
Elena: What are you talking about?
Damon: Stefan's still drinking human blood.
Elena: What?!
Damon: Yeah, a month ago I would have rejoiced but with the council back on the alert, it is not a good time for Stefan to fly off the handle.
Elena: I know he's been a little edgy but he said that was normal.
Damon: He has a fridge full of stolen blood bank contraband in the house.
[She sits down on the couch.]

Elena: Oh my god.
Damon: He has no idea what normal is, his entire existence isn't normal. Normal to a vampire is drinking human blood but he spent all this time fighting it when he should have been learning to control it and now it's controlling him instead.
Elena: I can't believe this. I mean, it's Stefan that we're talking about here.
Damon: Stefan on human blood Elena; he'll do anything, he'll say anything because he's not gonna want to stop. Trust me.
[Jeremy is running after Anna.]

Jeremy: Anna!
Anna: What is it?
Jeremy: Come on, don't be like that.
Anna: Why not? You were basically using me to turn you into a vampire so you could be with someone else.
Jeremy: No, I wasn't using you.
Anna: Really? And how would you like to define it?
Jeremy: Look, I don't think it's any worse than you becoming friends with me so you could give your mother my blood.
Anna: How do you know that?
Jeremy: It's not important.
Anna: Seriously, Jeremy. What do you know?
Jeremy: Everything. I know everything.
[Elena is still talking to Damon.]

Elena: This is all my fault; I'm the one who fed him the blood in the first place.
[Stefan enters, interrupting them.]

Stefan: What's going on in here?
Damon: I was just filling Elena on your extra-curricular activities.
Stefan [laughing]: What are you talking about?
Elena: I know about the blood, Stefan.
Damon: I'm uh - I'll be downstairs, drinking.
[He leaves. Stefan smiles.]

Stefan: I was going to tell you.
Elena: When?
Stefan: I'm fine. I'm fine, the blood, it doesn't change anything.
Elena: It's changing you.
Stefan: Why? Because I kept it a secret from you? Come on Elena, look, giving the way you're reacting right now, can you really blame me for doing that?
Elena: Are you hearing yourself right now? You've been stealing blood and lying and you say that everything's fine? Everything's not fine, Stefan!
Stefan: So what - so you and Damon all of a sudden have everything figured out then?
Elena: Its not about Damon. It's about what's happening to you.
Stefan: I know and I'm telling you that I'm fine. I'm fine. Please, come on. Elena I thought you...I thought you believed in me.
[Someone is knocking on the door. It's Carole Lockwood.]

Carol: Elena, let's go. The line-up's starting.
Elena: I just...I need a minute.
Carol: You're not even dressed yet. Escorts wait downstairs, Stefan.
[He looks at Elena and leaves.]

[Stefan goes into the bathroom and slams the door. He puts his fist into the mirror and breaks it. Amber enters in the bathroom.]

Amber: Oh God, sorry!
[Stefan's face has changed; he goes towards her.]

[The escorts, the mayor and a crowd of people are waiting for the girls.]

Mayor Lockwood: Miss Tina Fell, escorted by Bartholomew Whitmore.
[Tina goes down the stairs. Upstairs Caroline and Elena are waiting.]

Carol: Has anyone seen Amber?
Elena [looking if she sees Stefan downstairs]: Do you see Stefan down there?
[Caroline look above the balcony.]

Caroline: Nope, just my boring fill in escort.
Elena: What happened to Matt?
Caroline: They wouldn't let him out of work. Wait, what happened to Stefan?
Elena: I don't know, he just disappeared somewhere, I don't know. What am I doing? I never should have gone through with this.
Caroline: What do you mean?
Elena: I need to find Stefan, this isn't me, I'm not this person anymore.
Caroline: No, no, no way, no. You had your chance to drop out and believe me I was all for it because there is no way that I could beat you. Elena, you're doing this because it was important to your mom.
Mayor Lockwood: Miss Caroline Forbes and her escort Jeffrey Lockwood Hamilton.
[She looks at Elena and goes down the stairs.]

Carol: Elena, you're next.
[Jeremy is still talking with Anna.]

Anna: You're missing Elena's introduction.
Jeremy: I don't care.
Anna: So, she has no idea you read her journal?
Jeremy: She keeps things from me, I'm gonna keep things from her.
Anna: What are you gonna do now? Now that you know everything that she's been hiding from you?
Jeremy: I don't know. There's a part of me that's so angry, you know, that she covered up what happened to Vicki and erased my memory but there's also this other part of me that's glad. I...I don't want to remember Vicki like that.
Anna: As a monster?
Jeremy: No, as someone who wanted to hurt me.
Anna: When I met you, you were just a part of my plan to get my mother back but then things changed...All the time we spent together...I would never do anything to hurt you, not now. You know that right?
Jeremy: Yeah I know that.
[They look at each other and smile. John is behind them, he heard everything.]

[Stefan is in the parking lot with Amber; he has her by the arm and is walking with her.]

Amber: Where are we going?
Stefan: I don't know.
Amber: I'm in the ceremony.
[He pushes her against his car.]

Stefan: Not now you're not.
[He compels her.]

Stefan: You're standing in the parking lot with me.
Amber: I'm in the parking lot with you.
Stefan: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not very good to be around right now, I'm a little bit on the edge. I've been drinking the human stuff and it's really screwing with my head. She knows now. God! She wasn't supposed to found out, I didn't want her to found out, now everything's ruined.
Amber: You seem sad.
[He laughs.]

Stefan: I'm not sad. I'm freaking hungry!
[Elena is waiting upstairs.]

Mayor Lockwood: Miss Elena Gilbert, escorted by Mister Stefan Salvatore.
[Damon looks for Stefan. Elena goes down the stairs and looks for Stefan but she doesn't see him. Damon takes Stefan's place to escort Elena. She smiles and rejoins him.]

Elena: [whispering] Where is Stefan?
Damon: [whispering] I don't know.
[He takes her hand and they rejoins the others girls and their escorts outside. They pass by Jenna and Alaric.]

Jenna: [to Alaric] What is she doing with Damon?
Alaric: I have no idea.
[The couples take their positions for the dance. They bow and curtsey to their respective partner.]

Elena: [whispering] What are we gonna do?
Damon: [whispering] Right now, we just have to get through this.
[The girls and their escorts begin to dance. Elena and Damon dance, they look at each other and smile. The dance ends.]

[Stefan is still in the parking lot with Amber.]

Stefan: I don't hurt people. I don't do that. I'm the good brother.
Amber: Do you want to hurt me?
[He looks at her.]

Stefan: I want to kill you, I want to rip into your skin and I want to feed on your blood.
[He touches her hair and looks at her neck.]

Stefan: Under your skin, pulsating, floating.
[He touches her neck.]

Stefan: Your carotid artery right here. If you puncture this just right you can control the blood flow. It takes practice but it doesn't have to make a mess, you don't have to waste any.
Amber: What's stopping you?
Stefan [still touching amber's face]: If I do this, if I give in, there's no going back.
Amber: Then don't.
Stefan: I just want one taste; that's all I need, I just want one taste.
[His face changes.]

Amber: One taste.
[He finally bites her and drinks her blood.]

[The girls are on the stage, the mayor arrives.]

Caroline: Where is Amber?
Elena: I don't know.
Mayor Lockwood: Before I crown the winner, I'd like to offer a personal thank you to all of these young ladies for their efforts to better our community.
[Everyone applause.]

Mayor Lockwood: So, without further a due it is my honor to announce our very own Miss Mystic Falls, Miss Caroline Forbes!
[She is surprised. She and Elena are laughing.]

Elena: Congratulations!
Caroline: I actually won!
[They embrace each other; the mayor puts the banner around her shoulder.]

[John and Sheriff Forbes are in the bathroom where Stefan was earlier.]

John: There is blood on the glass.
[They look at each other.]

Sheriff Forbes: Get me Damon Salvatore.
[Stefan is still in the parking lot with Amber.]

Stefan: I can't do this.
Amber: What's the matter?
Stefan: I can't do this.
Amber: It's okay, it doesn't hurt that much, just not so hard next time.
Stefan: Oh god oh god oh god! I can't stop.
[He touches her face.]

Stefan: Why aren't you afraid of me?
Amber: You told me not to be.
Stefan: What? What's your name?
Amber: Amber.
Stefan: Listen to me, Amber. I need you to be afraid of me. I need you to run like hell do you understand me? Run, run now!
[She runs.]

[Damon is waiting for Elena, she rejoins him.]

Elena: What is it, did you find him?
Damon: There were signs of a struggle in the upstairs bathroom.
[Bonnie is looking at them.]

Damon: There was blood and that Amber girl is missing.
Elena: Oh my god! He wouldn't hurt her, he won't!
Damon: Let's just find him, okay? Let's get your coat come on!
[They leave, Bonnie follows them.]

[Amber is running but she falls into Stefan.]

Amber: You said to run!
Stefan: I changed my mind.
[She screams and he bites her. Elena, Damon and Bonnie arrive.]

Elena: Stefan!
[He releases her.]

Damon: Stefan, come on get control. It's okay, come on. Breath through it man.
[Stefan catches Damon and throws him against a tree. Damon gets up.]

Elena: Stefan stop it!
[All the sudden Stefan holds his head, Bonnie is casting a spell that hurts him. She stops.]

Damon: It's okay. Stefan.
[Stefan runs away.]

[The police arrive. Damon, Bonnie and Elena are still here.]

Sheriff Forbes: She doesn't remember what happened.
Damon: It's a good thing the girls got here when they did, she lost a lot of blood.
Sheriff Forbes [to Bonnie and Elena]: You didn't see anything?
[Long pause, Elena and Damon look at Bonnie.]

Elena: No, we just found her and then called Damon.
Bonnie: Is she gonna be okay?
Sheriff Forbes: It looks like it yeah. Why don't you girls get back to the party? Damon and I can take it from here.
Elena: Okay.
[Elena and Bonnie leave; Damon stays with the Sheriff.]

Sheriff Forbes: They didn't see the bite mark?
Damon: No, I got here before they got too close. There was too much blood, they couldn't see it clearly.
[They look at each other.]

[Bonnie goes to her car, Elena follows her.]

Elena: Bonnie, can we talk about this?
Bonnie: There's nothing to talk about.
Elena: Bonnie, please!
Bonnie: I told you I wasn't gonna make you choose but I need to make the choice for myself. Please just leave me alone.
[She gets into her car, Elena looks sad.]

[Jeremy is still talking to Anna. Jenna calls him.]

Jenna: Jer, are you ready?
Jeremy: Just a sec.
[She leaves and runs into John.]

John: Who's that girl with Jeremy?
Jenna: His friend, Anna.
John: What's her story?
Jenna: Why so nosy?
John: I'm just curious; he really seems to like her.
Jenna: She's new in town, I think. She and her mom Pearl, the family who you're so rudely trying to prevent from buying Grayson's building.
John [looking at Anna and Jeremy]: Her mother's name is Pearl?
Jenna: Yes, so?
John: Well, I believe I already know all about her.
[Alaric goes out, Elena is waiting for him.]

Alaric: Good, there you are. Jenna wanted me to get the car.
[He looks at Elena, and sees that she's upset.]

Alaric: What happened?
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is going home but Anna is waiting for him.]

Damon: All right now, this is getting weird.
Anna: We're here to talk.
[Pearl arrives.]

Damon: Not in the mood, today's been a no good, very bad day.
Pearl: Annabelle tells me you're looking for something I took from Jonathan Gilbert.
Damon: Im listening.
[She gives him the device.]

Damon: What is it?
Pearl: Jonathan was passionate about his inventions. He confided in me that he had created a detection device meant to track down the town's vampire element.
Damon: It was a pocket watch.
Pearl: That's what it turned out to be yes. But that's not what I stole. I discovered my mistake when I saw the watch in Jonathan's hand, the night they took us, its stile pointed at me.
[Damon looks at the device.]

Damon: So what is this?
Pearl: I have no idea but now it's yours.
Damon: What's the catch?
Pearl: There is no catch. My daughter wants to stay here. I want to stay here. You refused to trust us and for good reason. Consider this an apology.
[He looks at them and leaves.]

[Stefan enters in his bedroom, he tries to calm down. Elena arrives.]

Stefan: You shouldn't be here.
Elena: I know.
Stefan: Now you know.
Elena: That wasn't you.
Stefan: Oh, it was absolutely me. A monster, a predator, that's who I am Elena.
Elena: That's what the blood makes you.
Stefan: The blood brings out what's inside of me and if you think any differently then you're an idiot.
Elena: I know this isn't you Stefan.
Stefan: I wanted to drain every ounce of blood from that girl's body.
Elena: No.
Stefan: It's who I am Elena.
Elena: No, you can't scare me off.
Stefan: Why would you risk it? Why would you come here?
Elena: Because I did this, this is my fault; I'm the one who made you drink the blood.
Stefan: All you did was expose me to who I really am.
Elena: This isn't you.
Stefan [screaming]: Stop saying that!!!
[She starts walking towards him.]

Stefan: Don't get any closer to me.
Elena: I'm not gonna let this happen to you.
Stefan: Stop.
Elena: Stefan, I'm not gonna give up on you! I believe in you!
Stefan: Stop!!!
[He pushes her against the wall very roughly and slams his fist into the wall.]

Stefan: Stop!
[She's afraid; he looks at her.]

Stefan: I'm so sorry.
Elena: It's okay. It's okay.
[He puts his head on her shoulder. He begins to cry.]

Stefan: I don't know what's happening to me.
Elena: It's okay, Stefan. Its okay. You're gonna be okay.
[She takes a vervain dart and stabs him with it. He falls and Damon enters in the room, she looks at him.]

Damon: Sure you want to do this?
Elena: I'm sure.
[They put him in a cell in the basement. He closes the door.]

Damon: There's no guarantee it's going to work.
Elena: It has to.
Damon: Coming?
Elena: I'm gonna stay here.
[She sits down opposite the cell door, resting her back against the wall. Damon looks at her for a moment then sits down as well, facing her.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is locked up in a cell in the basement. He is hallucinating due to the lack of blood.]

Woods 1864
[In a flashback, the town is capturing vampires.]

Man: We have to get to the church. They're waiting.
Stefan [to Damon]: Circle around that way. I'll distract them. Go. [To the group of men.] Over here! There's another one! Quick! Help me!
Johnathan: Arm yourselves.
[The men follow Stefan. Only one man is standing guard over the carriage containing the vampires. Damon hits him and knocks him out. Stefan returns. Damon grabs the keys out of the man's pocket and unlocks the carriage.]

Stefan: We don't have long.
Damon: Katherine. Katherine.
[Damon and Stefan lift Katherine out of the carriage. They untie her and take off the muzzle that covers her mouth.]

Stefan: We're going to get you out of here. Damon, hurry. Hurry.
[Damon is shot at. He dies. Stefan rushes over to him.]

Stefan: No! No. Damon.
Men: Come on. Let's go.
Stefan: Uhh!
[Stefan runs and grabs a gun, but he is shot down too.]

Salvatore Boarding House and Woods 1864
[Stefan is drifting in and out between the present and past.]

Damon: Stefan. Stefan.
Elena: Stefan.
Katherine and Elena: I love you, Stefan.
[Katherine is taken back into the carriage in the past. Damon leads Elena out in the present. She looks through the bars at him.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena and Damon are in the cellar. Elena is watching Stefan.]

Elena: It's so hard to see him locked up like this.
Damon: You're the one who locked him up.
Elena: You helped.
Damon: I couldn't have him running around chewing on people. While the town was looking for vampires, now, could I?
Elena: It had nothing to do with you actually caring about him?
Damon: Your thing, not mine.
Quarry 1864
[In another flashback, Stefan awakes with a start. He opens his shirt and sees the bullet wound is gone. He also sees a ring on his hand and examines it. Emily is there.]

Emily: Katherine had me make that for you weeks ago.
Stefan: Where am I?
Emily: The quarry just north of town. My brother and I brought you here last night. We found you dead in the woods.
Stefan: Where's Damon? Am I...am I a...?
Emily: Not yet. You're in transition.
Stefan: But how? I...
Emily: You had Katherine's blood in your system when you died.
Stefan: No. I never...
Emily: She's been compelling you to drink it for weeks, Stefan.
Stefan: And Damon?
Emily: No compulsion was necessary. He drank from her willingly.
[Stefan joins Damon by the river.]

Damon: I woke up last night. I didn't know where I was. I went to the church. And I watched them drag her inside. Then they set fire to it. And the whole church went up into flames. They killed her, Stefan. She's gone.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon looks at the object which Pearl gave him, Elena enters the living room.]

Elena: Did you ever figure out what that is?
Damon: Nope. Whatever it is, it doesn't work.
Elena: Pearl didn't say anything else about it?
Damon: She thought she was stealing his vampire compass, but that was a pocket watch. That Johnathan Gilbert was a crazy scientist. Have you spoken to your uncle lately?
Elena: I've been avoiding him, actually. That, and I've been here most nights.
Damon: So, you'll be here again tonight?
Elena: Is that a problem?
Damon: Yes. You're a complete nuisance.
Elena: Heh. See you later.
Mystic Falls High School
[Jeremy is walking to class. Anna joins him.]

Anna: Hey. Surprise.
Jeremy: What are you doing here?
Anna: Picking up this.
Jeremy: A class schedule?
Anna: Starting tomorrow, I'm officially a student here.
Jeremy: You're kidding me, right?
Anna: No. I finally beat my mom down.
Jeremy: Heh. But why would you want to go to high school? It blows.
Anna: Do I really need to answer that?
Jeremy: You'd suffer through all this just to hang out with me?
Anna: Yeah. I would.
Jeremy: That's, um...
Anna: Stupid? Pathetic? Old lurky me?
Jeremy: It's awesome. It's awesome.
[They kiss.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon brings a bottle of blood for Stefan.]

Damon: Brought you something to eat...100 percent Stefan diet approved. You know what will happen if you don't eat. You'll get all rotting and crusty.
Stefan: I'm not hungry.
Damon: Of course you are. We're eternally hungry. Take it. The human blood should be gone by now. You want to explain why you're still in here. Feeling sorry for yourself? Come on. Drink up. Fine. Starve. What do I care?
[Damon enters the living room. His phone rings.]

Damon: Hello?
Alaric: Hey, it's Alaric Saltzman.
Damon: Before I hang up, how did you get this number?
Alaric: Ah, it's a mystery. Listen, I've, uh, been doing some digging on Elena's uncle. You interested?
Damon: What kind of digging?
Alaric: I've got an old friend from Duke. Who studied criminology when we were there together. Let's just say he's become a very proficient digger.
Damon: Well, did he find anything?
Alaric: Well, I had him run a track on John's cell records. He was getting a call from a number...The same number that Elena dialed to get Isobel. And then the number was disconnected.
Damon: Isobel knows John. Whatever. We knew that.
Alaric: Right. Well, after that, he started getting calls from a new number. And I had my friend run a geotrack. Got the address. It's...It's an apartment in Grove Hill.
Damon: Isobel's in Grove Hill?
Alaric: I don't know. I thought we could take a look and see what we find.
Damon: Perfect. Give me the address.
Alaric: Oh, so you can go without me? No. I don't think so.
Damon: I'm not going with you. You tried to kill me.
Alaric: Yeah, well, you did kill me.
Damon: Hold on.
[Damon is getting another call.]

Damon: What?
Elena: I'm just grabbing some clothes, and then I'll be right over. How's Stefan?
Damon: Extra broody. Hold on. [He goes back to Alaric.] You drive. Pick me up in an hour.
Alaric: Done.
[Damon hangs up. He goes back to talking to Elena on the phone.]

Damon: He won't eat anything.
Elena: He has to eat what's his favorite...Kind of, um...
Damon: His favorite kind of what?
Elena: Type of animal blood that he prefers?
Damon: Ew. Gross.
Elena: Heh. Your joking doesn't help.
Damon: Helps me. Now, hurry up. I can't baby-sit all night. I have things to do.
Elena: I would say, drop dead, but...
Damon: Ha ha. Stefan likes...Puppy blood...Little golden retriever puppies with cute, floppy ears. That's his favorite.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena hangs up on Damon, scoffing at him. She closes her closet door and John is standing behind it.]

John: Sorry.
Elena: Uncle John. I didn't see you there.
John: I thought we could talk. We haven't had a chance to catch up.
Elena: I'm actually just heading out, so...
John: Well, it won't take long.
Elena: What did you want to talk about?
John: Well...I know you know.
Elena: Know what?
John: It's really silly to keep pretending. What do you think your mother would say. If she knew you were dating a vampire?
Elena: Which mother?
[She raises an eyebrow at John before turning round and leaving.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan is sitting on the floor of the cell. He has a flashback.]

Quarry 1864
[Stefan gets a pail of water. He brings it over to where Damon is sitting. They wash out their shirts with the water.]

Stefan: I bet Johnathan Gilbert has told father by now. Wonder how he took the news that we're dead.
Damon: As if he cares. He betrayed us.
Stefan: He thought he was protecting us, Damon. He thought he was protecting this town.
Damon: God. This sun hurts my eyes.
Stefan: It's part of it. The muscle aches, the sick feeling...Emily says it's our bodies pushing us to feed, to complete the transition.
Damon: That's not gonna happen.
Stefan: Is that your choice, then? To die instead?
Damon: Isn't it yours? This was all to be with Katherine. But she's gone. I want it over.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena goes down to the basement to see Stefan.]

Elena: How you feelin'? Damon says you need to drink that. You need it, Stefan. Can't survive without it.
Stefan: I don't want to survive.
Elena: What? Don't say that.
Stefan: I'm sorry, Elena. No more. After what I've done, it has to end. I just want it over.
[Elena is sitting in the living room and talking to Damon.]

Damon: He's just being dramatic. He's not gonna starve himself.
Elena: Why would he say that?
Damon: He feels bad about hurting that girl. It's a very typical Stefan martyr stuff. It will pass.
Elena: Will it? Because he seemed to be in a lot of pain.
Damon: Yeah. Well, that will pass, too, once he eats.
Elena: I didn't mean physical pain.
Damon: I know what you meant. Look, are you gonna be okay here if I have to run out? I have to go to an errand with the teacher.
Elena: The teacher? Alaric? Are you two friends now?
Damon: I don't have any friends, Elena.
Elena: Right.
Damon: You should, um, you should stay up here. You shouldn't be down there by yourself.
Elena: I'll be fine.
Damon: You know...You're very trusting of him, given the circumstances.
Elena: So are you. Otherwise, you wouldn't be leaving.
Damon: I won't be long.
Mystic Grill
[Pearl joins John at a table.]

Pearl: Hello, Mr. Gilbert.
John: Pearl. What a pleasure. I must admit, I'm surprised that you came.
Pearl: Jenna tells me that you wanted to discuss the sale of the building in person.
John: Still, revealing yourself to me like this, it took quite a risk.
Pearl: I'm not stupid, Mr. Gilbert. You knew who I was when you requested the meeting. So, Damon tells me that you're looking for the device I took from Johnathan. I'm sure you realize I have no intention of giving it to you.
John: That's why I wanted to meet you. I'm planning on changing your mind.
Pearl: Really? How so?
John: With my Gilbert charm. I know that you have a weakness for it. May I buy you a drink?
[He signals a waiter.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy and Anna are talking in his bedroom.]

Jeremy: So, your mother was in love with Johnathan Gilbert, and he betrayed her?
Anna: Yup.
Jeremy: And now my uncle John wants this invention-device thing that she gave to Damon.
Anna: That's pretty much it.
Jeremy: John mentioned there were more Gilbert journals. I bet that's how he knows everything.
Anna: Do we have to talk about this all night? I've told you everything. I probably shouldn't have, 'cause that could get us both in a lot of trouble.
Jeremy: I'm not gonna say anything.
Anna: Your uncle John wants us dead.
Jeremy: Oh, you don't know that.
Anna: Yes, I do. He's a hater, Jeremy.
Jeremy: Well, I'm not.
Anna: No. You're something else entirely.
Jeremy: Oh, yeah? What would that be?
Anna: My weakness.
[Jeremy and Anna start kissing and taking each other's clothes off.]

Jeremy: I don't want Jenna to walk in on us.
Anna: Jenna's in the kitchen. She just opened the refrigerator.
Jeremy: Wait. You can hear that? That is so cool.
[He goes back to kissing her.]

Grove Hill Residence
[Damon and Alaric are at the apartment.]

Alaric: This is the one here. The records show is was paid 3 months in advance.
Damon: This is where it gets tricky. I may or may not be able to get in.
Alaric: Yeah, how does that work? You always have to be invited in?
Damon: By the owner or the person of entitlement. Short-term rentals and hotels are a bit of a gray area. You kind of gotta play it by ear.
Alaric: Heh. Could we not kill anyone tonight, please?
Damon: You mean, you just brought me along for my company?
[Damon opens the door.]

Alaric: It doesn't look like anyone's home.
Damon: Yeah. I'm good. No permanent resident, apparently.
[Damon opens the fridge and see blood bags.]

Damon: Uh, Ric, we have company.
[A man jumps on Alaric. Alaric stabs him with wood knuckles. The man attacks again. Damon throws him off of Alaric.]

Damon: Boys, boys, that's enough. I know you.
Henry: Damon?
Damon: Your name is Henry. You were in the tomb.
Henry: Yes, sir. What are you doing here?
Salvatore Estate 1864
[Stefan is approaching his house. He hears Johnathan and his father talking.]

Giuseppe: May I offer you a drink, Mr. Gilbert?
Johnathan: Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.
Giuseppe: This won't take much longer.
Johnathan: I want to make sure the founders' archives are accurate.
Giuseppe: Be sure you document the loss of civilian life in the church.
Johnathan: They were hardly civilians, Mr. Salvatore.
Giuseppe: As far as anyone needs to know, they were. As the record keeper for the Council, what you write will be passed down through generations. Certain details should be kept only between you and me.
Johnathan: For example?
Giuseppe: My sons. They will be remembered as the innocent victims of the Battle of Willow Creek, not for their shame.
Johnathan: Certainly, Mr. Salvatore.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena walks back down to the cellar.]

Stefan: You know, Damon hasn't fed me vervain in a while. I could be at those bars in a flash, and you'd be dead.
Elena: Yeah, you could. But you won't.
Stefan: Please just go away. I don't want you here.
[Elena enters the cellar.]

Stefan: What are you doing? Get out of here.
Elena: No.
Stefan: You're taking a stupid risk. I could hurt you.
Elena: Then I'm stupid. You need to drink this.
Stefan: Elena, get out of here, or you'll regret it.
Elena: Drink.
Stefan: [Shouting.] I said get out!
[He knocks the bottle of blood from her hand. His face transformed.]

Elena: No.
Grove Hill Residence
[Damon and Alaric talk with Henry.]

Henry: So, how do you know John Gilbert?
Damon: Well, I've known him for years. He's a good friend. How do you know him?
Henry: I met him right after I got out of the tomb. He's been helping me out.
Alaric: Helping you out how?
Henry: Adapting. It's a whole new world...Cars, computers, match.com. There's so much to learn. He helped me get this place.
Alaric: So, do you live here alone or is there someone else here?
Damon: That's my friend's very passive-aggressive way of asking, uh, do you know a woman named Isobel?
Henry: Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel. I know John. He's my only real friend. He really showed me the ropes...how to use a microwave, separate my whites.
Alaric: What else do you do for him?
Henry: I help keep an eye on things...You know, with the others.
Damon: The others?
Henry: From the tomb. They're still pissed at the founding families for trying to burn them alive. I'm cool, but those tomb boys, they want revenge.
Alaric: What does John want with them?
Henry: He's just keeping an eye on them, you know? Trying to make sure they stay out of trouble.
Damon: Well, that's John. Heh. He's such a do-gooder.
[Henry receives a call.]

Henry: Heh. That's John now.
Damon: Oh. Hey, let me talk to him.
Henry: All right. Yeah. Are you gonna answer that?
Damon: Am I gonna...answer that?
[Alaric shakes his head.]

Henry: What's going on?
[Henry senses a trap and runs at Alaric. Damon grabs him. Alaric stabs him with a stake.]

Damon: Let's not not kill anyone tonight. Your words. Just pointing that out.
Mystic Grill
[John returns to the table.]

John: My apologies.
Pearl: No apologies necessary. So, tell me, Mr. Gilbert, why should I let you have the device?
John: Because I can help you. I'm connected around here. The Town Council's eating out of my hand. They do whatever I say. And I know that you just want to live your life. Complete with a white picket fence, and I can help you do that.
Pearl: But the device doesn't work. Why would you even want it?
John: It's a family heirloom. Call me sentimental.
Pearl: Johnathan was ahead of his time.
John: I read his journals. They're very extensive. He actually wrote about you. You were his one regret. He loved you, and he hated himself for what he did to you.
Pearl: You're lying.
John: No. On his last days, he wrote how sorry he was. You were the only woman he ever loved.
[A smile slowly stretches across John's face and then he chuckles.]

John: Good God. You vampires...you're so emotional. Johnathan Gilbert hated you. His only regret was that he didn't drive a stake through your heart himself.
Pearl: I gave it to Damon.
John: What?
Pearl: I gave your device to Damon. Why don't you ask him for it yourself? I'm sure he'd be delighted to give it to you. And then, Mr. Gilbert, may you rot in hell.
[Pearl leaves.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena is sitting in the cellar with Stefan.]

Elena: Talk to me, Stefan. Why are you doing this?
Stefan: I'm making the decision I should have made years ago.
Elena: What are you talking about?
Stefan: You have to feed in order to complete the transition.
Elena: I know that.
Stefan: It was a choice I shouldn't have made.
Salvatore Estate 1864
[Stefan enters his fathers office. Giuseppe looks up from his desk and stands up in surprise.]

Giuseppe: Dear God!
Stefan: Even in our death, you only feel shame?
Giuseppe: You're one of them now.
Stefan: No. Father, I came to say good-bye.
Giuseppe: I watched you die.
Stefan: You were there when we were shot?
Giuseppe: I pulled the trigger myself.
Stefan: You killed your own sons?
Giuseppe: You were both dead to me the moment you sided with the vampires. I only thank God that your mother isn't alive to see the disgrace you've become.
Stefan: I haven't turned yet. I don't want to. I'm going to let myself die, father. Please.
Giuseppe: Yes, you are.
[Giuseppe gets out at wooden rod, breaks it in two, and attempts to stab Stefan. Stefan throws him against the wall. The stake has impaled his father. Stefan rushes towards him.]

Giuseppe: Uhh!
Stefan: Father, I didn't mean to.
Giuseppe: Get away from me.
Stefan: No, let me help you. Please.
[Stefan removes the stake from his father's chest. He sees the blood on the stake and his fingers. He licks his fingers. He touches his father's wound and licks more blood from his fingers. His eyes start to transform.]

Giuseppe: Ohh. Ohh.
Stefan: Uhh. Uhh! Oh, God. What's happening to me?
[Stefan feels the fangs that have grown in his mouth.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Stefan and Elena are still talking in the cellar.]

Stefan: How can you even look at me right now?
Elena: You need to be able to talk about these things, Stefan. I need to hear them. Come upstairs. We can talk about it more, and we'll keep talking as long as you need.
Stefan: You're so sure I'm ready?
[Elena pulls out Stefan's ring and places it on the cot next to him.]

Elena: And when you feel the same way...I'll be upstairs.
Grove Hill Residence
[Damon empties the blood bags.]

Damon: Find anything yet?
Alaric: No, I looked everywhere. The place is...The place is clean.
Damon: Well, I found this. Behind the blood in the fridge.
Alaric: Oh, man, this was a real dead-end.
Damon: I wouldn't beat myself up over it, man. What did you think you were gonna find, huh? Isobel with a cigar and slippers?
Alaric: Oh, man. I...I gotta stop this. I can't...I can't keep searching for her.
Damon: Really? After only two years? That's actually moderately healthy.
Alaric: What are you going on? 146?
Damon: Well, I figure the 200 mark is probably a good stopping point.
Alaric: Ahh. I mean, no answer is enough. I keep thinking I wanna know why, when, you know, the precise moment. When my wife decided life with me wasn't enough.
Damon: She charmed me, your wife Isobel. She talked a good game, man. She was smart. She had this excitement in her eyes. I probably should have known there was something different about her, some tie to Katherine. There had to be some reason I didn't kill her.
Alaric: That's enough, Damon. I don't wanna hear anymore. I just don't want to waste any more of my life. Searching for answers that I really don't want. I'm through with Isobel. I...I'm done with all of this. Yeah.
Pearl's Residence
[Anna enters the house.]

Anna: Hey. What's the matter?
Pearl: I need you to pack your things. We're leaving.
Anna: What? No.
Pearl: I was wrong to think that we could make a home here. It's time for us to move on.
Anna: But I don't want to move on. I want to stay.
Pearl: We can't stay. There's too many people here who know the truth...Too much history.
Anna: So, what, you're just gonna give up, pack us up, and move us out?
Pearl: It's not safe here. You know that.
Anna: Please.
Pearl: Is this is about Jeremy?
Anna: No. It's about me finally getting to build a life for myself. Please, mama.
Pearl: You gave me my life back. I am just trying to protect yours. I can't force you. It's your decision.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena is writing in her diary. Damon enters the room.]

Damon: Ugh. God. You're still here?
Elena: Were you expecting anything else?
Damon: No. Ahh.
[Damon picks up Elena's legs and sits down on the couch. He places her legs over his lap.]

Elena: So, how was the errand?
Damon: Futile. Although, I think I witnessed the teacher having an existential crisis. Has Stefan eaten yet?
Elena: I thought you didn't care.
Damon: Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.
Elena: I think he's getting there. But he's got a lot of guilt that he has to deal with. And it doesn't help that you've spent the last 145 years punishing him for Katherine getting caught.
Damon: This is my fault now?
Elena: No, it's no one's fault, Damon. I'm just...saying you're not exactly innocent. You've made it your life's mission to make him miserable.
[Damon gets up.]

Damon: Let me ask you a question. In all this important soul-searching and cleansing of the demons of Stefan's past, did you ever manage to get the rest of the story?
Elena: He said there was more.
Damon: Yeah. That's an understatement.
[Elena gets up and goes towards Damon.]

Elena: Damon...Damon. Tell me.
Quarry 1864
[In a flashback, Stefan returns with a girl.]

Damon: What are you doing? Who is that?
Stefan: I brought her for you. She's a gift. Have a seat, please.
Damon: What have you done, Stefan?
Stefan: Damon, I've been to see father. He came at me. I didn't know my own strength. There was blood everywhere. He was dying, and the blood was too strong. I needed it. I had to have it.
Damon: You fed.
Stefan: Yes. And it's incredible. My body is exploding with power, Damon.
Damon: No.
Stefan: I can hear things from far away. I can see through the darkness. I can move, like it's magic. And the guilt, the pain...Damon, I can turn it off. Like a switch. Katherine was right. It's a whole another world out there, Damon.
Damon: Katherine is dead, Stefan. There's no world without her.
Stefan: No. You can turn that off, too. You don't have to feel that pain anymore.
Damon: I don't want it.
Stefan: You're weak. You'll be dead soon. You need this.
Damon: No.
Stefan: You'll die.
Damon: No. I can't.
Stefan: Please. I won't let you die.
Damon: No. I can't.
Stefan: Don't fight it. We can do this...together.
[Damon drinks the blood of the girl.]

Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: From the moment Stefan had his first taste of human blood, he was a different person. I suppose I should thank him. It's been a hell of a ride. Heh.
Elena: Oh, my God. He said he wanted to die. That's why he won't feed. Now I understand why, but...
Damon: His choice. If he's stupid enough to make it, so be it.
Elena: Don't do that. Okay? Don't pretend like you don't care.
Damon: Where are you going?
[Elena goes down into the cellar. Stefan is gone, but his ring is still on the cot. Elena picks it up and runs out of the cell.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is asleep in his bed, Anna joins him.]

Jeremy: Hey.
Anna: It's getting impossible to sneak up on you.
Jeremy: Nice try, though.
Anna: Sorry I woke you.
Jeremy: That's okay. You only woke me halfway.
Anna: So, listen. I...
Jeremy: That feels good.
[She kisses him.]

Anna: Good-bye.
Quarry
[Stefan is at the quarry where Damon turned.]

Quarry 1864
[Stefan and Damon are both vampires now.]

Stefan: How do you feel?
Damon: You were right. It is a whole new world.
Stefan: We can explore it together.
Damon: You got what you wanted...You and me for all eternity. But here this, brother. I will make it an eternity of misery for you.
Stefan: Damon!
[Damon leaves. Stefan, in the present, is looking weak. In the past, Emily finds Stefan.]

Emily: You've transitioned.
Stefan: You'd have rather found me dead?
Emily: Katherine saved my life once. I owed her. That doesn't mean I'd wish her curse on anyone.
Stefan: It feels more like a gift.
Emily: That will change.
Stefan: Why is that?
Emily: Because even in death, your heart is pure, Stefan. I sense that about you. That will be your curse.
Stefan: Emily, wait.
Quarry
[Stefan is still at the quarry. Elena approaches him.]

Elena: Stefan. Damon told me the rest of the story. I thought I might find you here.
Stefan: I should have died that night, just like I had chosen. I should have let Damon die, too.
Elena: But you didn't. And if you die now, it's not gonna change what happened.
Stefan: Every single person that's been hurt...Every single life that's been lost, it's because of me.
Elena: The night that my parents died...I blew off family night so that I could go to some party. I ended up getting stranded, and they had to come pick me up. That's why we ended up in the car at Wickery Bridge. And that's why they died. Our actions are what set things in motion. But we have to live with that.
Stefan: I made a choice, Elena. Because of that choice, a lot of people were hurt.
Elena: You also made a choice to stop, to reject the person that the blood made you. You made a choice to be good, Stefan.
Stefan: No. Please don't do that.
Elena: That's the person who jumped in the water to save the family whose car had driven off the bridge.
Stefan: Please. Don't make this all okay.
Elena: That's the person who saved my life.
Stefan: You don't understand, Elena.
Elena: Then tell me.
Stefan: It hurts me. It hurts me, knowing what I've done, and that pain...That pain is with me all the time. And every day, I think that if I just...If I just give myself over to the blood, I can make that pain stop. It would be that easy, and every day, I fight that. And I am so terrified that one day, I'm not gonna want to fight that anymore, Elena. And the next time I hurt somebody...It could be you.
Elena: There will be no next time.
Stefan: You don't know that.
Elena: Maybe I don't. But what I do know. Is that you can take this, throw it in the quarry, and let the sun rise. Or you could take this ring and put it on and keep fighting.
[Elena gives him his ring and she kisses him.]

Elena: It's your choice.
[Elena starts to walk away.]

Stefan: Elena.
[Stefan puts on his ring and runs to Elena and kisses her passionately.]

Pearl's Residence
[Harper prepares the luggage of Pearl.]

Pearl: Thank you, Harper.
Harper: You're welcome.
Pearl: Annabelle should be back in a minute. You know, you don't have to come with us if you don't want to.
Harper: This was never my home, Miss Pearl. I was just a soldier who was left to die. You saved me. I'm coming with you.
Pearl: Let me help you with these.
[Pearl opens the main door and receives a pile in the heart. Harper catches her.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena and Stefan walk into the library. Damon is sitting there.]

Damon: Little boy lost.
Elena: I'll be upstairs, OK?
Stefan: Okay.
Elena: Good night, Damon.
[Elena goes away.]

Stefan: Thank you.
Damon: No, Stefan, thank you. You're back on Bambi blood, and I'm the big badass brother again. All is right in the world.
Stefan: I mean it. Thank you. For...helping her take care of me.
Damon: You brood too much. Everything on this planet is not your fault. My actions, what I do, it's not your fault. I own them. They belong to me. You are not allowed to feel my guilt.
Stefan: Do you feel guilt?
Damon: If I wanted to, it's there. Emily waited till after I turned to tell me she'd been successful in protecting Katherine with her spell. She didn't want me to know about the tomb. She thought it would impact my decision.
Stefan: She didn't want either one of us to turn. She said it was a curse.
Damon: Witches...Judgy little thing.
Stefan: Why didn't you tell me?
Damon: 'Cause I didn't want you to know. 'Cause I hated you and I still do.
Stefan: I know.
Damon: But not because you forced me to turn.
Stefan: Then why?
Damon: Because she turned you. It was just supposed to be me, Stefan...Just me.
Pearl's Residence
[Anna enters the house and discovers her mother and Harper, staked in the heart.]

Anna: I'm back. Oh! Mom! Mama! Uhh! Please don't leave me again. No. Please wake up. You have to wake up. No.
Woods
[John puts some stakes in the trunk of his car and calls Sheriff Forbes.]

John: Sheriff Forbes, it's John Gilbert. Sorry to call so late. I have an update about the vampires.
Mystic Grill
[Alaric, sits at the bar, drinking alone. A woman approaches him.]

Isobel: Hello, Ric.
[Alaric slowly faces Isobel.]

Alaric: Isobel.

Mystic Grill
[Isobel and Alaric are standing at the bar.]

Isobel: It's good to see you. You look good. I hear that you're a high school history teacher? How is that?
Alaric: Where have you been, Isobel?
Isobel: I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you. I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you. I wanted this.
Alaric: It's that simple?
Isobel: Yeah. You were supposed to mourn me, and move on.
Alaric: You were my wife, and I loved you. How could I not search for you?
Isobel: Because I wasn't lost, Rick.
[She takes a paper and writes something.]

Isobel: I understand that you know my daughter Elena and I hear that she's been looking for me. So...
[She gives the paper to Alaric.]

Isobel: I want you to arrange for a meeting with us.
[Alaric looks at the paper.]

Alaric: You want me to deliver a message?
Isobel [smiles]: Yeah.
[Alaric throws the paper.]

Alaric: Screw you. You selfish bitch.
[He gets up and leaves.]

[In the parking lot, Alaric is going to his car. Isobel arrives behind him.]

Alaric: What do you want from me?
Isobel: I told you.
Alaric: I'm not gonna do anything for you.
[She strangles him and pushes him against his car.]

Isobel: You better tell Elena that I want to meet or I'm gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one and I'm gonna start with your history students. Got it?
[She throws him on the floor and gives him the paper. He gets up and looks at the paper.]

Gilbert Residence
[Elena is on the phone with Damon.]

Elena: I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic float for the Founders' Day parade. If I don't I get the wrath of Caroline but I wanted to check in first.
Damon: Well, I'm doing great, thanks for asking.
Elena: Checking on Stefan.
Damon: Oh, him? Oh, he's...he's terrible.
Elena: What's the matter?
Damon: He's just back to boring, straight-laced, off the junk. You've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality.
Elena: Don't forget who helped me.
Damon: I hate myself. [smiles] Did Uncle John mention anything to you about my field trip with the history teacher?
Elena: No. I'm still been avoiding him. Why? What's he up to?
Damon: I don't know. But I'd love if you could find out for me.
Elena: I've got to go I'm late.
Damon: Have fun with the Mystic queen, I know I did.
[Elena hangs up.]

Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon hangs up. He gets up and gives the phone to Stefan.]

Damon: Elena called.
[He smiles and leaves the room. Stefan looks at him and then at his phone.]

Mystic Falls High School
[At the Cafeteria, Alaric is giving papers to students.]

Alaric: So these are the specs for the History department. For the Founders' Day float we'll be recreating the battle of Willow Creek. Tyler has been nominated at the head of the production design.
Tyler: By whom?
Alaric: By me. I've seen your sketches and they're good.
Tyler: I'm not really into the...
Alaric: Well, you just pick your team, be creative and...[He sees Elena and Stefan] Don't screw up.
[Alaric is going towards Elena and Stefan.]

Tyler: Great! [To Matt]: You want to help me out with this?
Matt: Not really, no.
Elena: Hey Mr. Saltzman.
Alaric: Come with me. We need to talk.
[Stefan and Elena are going with him and look at each other.]

Bonnie: Alright, show me.
Caroline: Let's reference last years Miss Mystic float.
[She types Mystic Falls Founders' Day into Bing on her computer.]

Caroline: This is what they did last year [She turns her computer and shows a picture to Bonnie] and this is exactly what we don't want to do.
Bonnie: Ew. Okay! So, what are we doing?
Caroline: Southern classic elegance.
Bonnie: Gone with the Wind?
Caroline: How'd you know?
Bonnie: You channel Scarlett, daily.
Caroline: So true!
[They laugh. Caroline is looking around.]

Caroline: Where's Elena? She's supposed to be helping.
Bonnie: I don't know.
Caroline: Okay, what's the deal?
Bonnie: What do you mean?
Caroline: Don't play dumb. You and Elena are fighting. Spill!
Bonnie: It's nothing.
Caroline: It's not nothing. You know this whole float is supposed to be about friends creating something together and everyone is fighting. Matt and Tyler hate each other, you and Elena are on the outs and I don't like it! And I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong.
Bonnie: I can't talk about it, Caroline, I'm sorry.
[Caroline looks at her.]

[Damon enters Alaric's classroom.]

Alaric: Damon, thanks for coming.
Damon: Sorry I'm late. My dog ate my uh...never mind.
[He looks at Stefan and Elena.]

Damon: What's with all the furrowed brows?
Alaric: I saw Isobel last night.
Damon: Isobel is here? [Alaric nods] In town?
[He turns to Elena and looks at her.]

Isobel's Residence
[John drives his car towards the house. There is a sign reading Ulisky Realty FOR SALE Foreclosure Open House out the front. He parks his car and enters in the house. He's going into a room. A man and a woman are dancing. Isobel is watching them.]

Isobel: You're late.
John: I didn't realize there was a schedule. What's with the side show?
Isobel: Cherie is a little jazz singer that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn. And I got the cowboy at a gay rodeo in Amarillo.
John: He's gay?
Isobel: Not right now, he's very good to me. [To the men and the women] Hey Cherie? Cassez vous!
[They leave.]

Isobel: I'm teaching them French. Oh! I can smell the judgment coming off of you.
John: Well, they're people, Isobel, and you're treating them like dolls.
Isobel: If we're gonna be partners you really have to stop being such a hater.
John: We're in a partnership together because we share a mutual goal. Don't ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle.
Isobel: My lifestyle? So, I assume that you still don't have the invention.
John: I'll get it. I said I would.
Isobel: Uh, you threatened to expose Damon Salvatore, that didn't work. You killed that Pearl lady, still no invention. I really don't think that your plan is working, John.
John: Well, you being here is not going to help anything.
[She slaps him at vamp-speed. He falls.]

Isobel: You failed, John. I'm gonna take it from here.
[John sits up, take a breath, looks at her walking away.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric and Damon talk in Alaric's classroom.]

Damon: Did you ask her about Uncle John? Are they working together?
Alaric: No.
Damon: No they're not?
Alaric: No, I didn't ask.
Damon: What about the invention?
Alaric: Didn't ask.
Damon: Did she know about the tomb vampires?
Alaric: I don't know.
Damon: Did words completely escape you?
Alaric: No, I was a little too distracted by my dead vampire wife to ask any questions.
[Damon turns to Elena.]

Damon: What did she want?
Elena: She wants to see me, Damon.
[He looks at her.]

Stefan: Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting. We don't know why or what she wants.
Damon [still looking at Elena]: You don't have to see her if you don't want to.
[Stefan, confused by this sudden sensitivity, looks at Damon and then at Elena.]

Elena: I don't really have a choice.
Alaric: She's threatened to go on killing spree.
Damon: Oh! I take it that's not okay with you guys.
Elena: I want to do it. I want to meet her. If I don't, I know I'll regret it.
[Damon and Elena look at each other.]

Mystic Grill
[Elena is sitting alone. Stefan is standing at the pool table. He watches after Elena.]

Elena: Can you hear me? Thanks for coming, I'm nervous.
[Stefan smiles at her.]

Elena: I'm happy that you're here. I love you.
[Stefan moves his lips and tells her I love you. Isobel arrives and sits down with her.]

Isobel: Hello Elena. You look just like her, that's eerie.
Elena: You've met Katherine?
Isobel: She found me after I turned. Genetic curiosity, I suppose. She would be fascinated by you.
[Elena looks at Isobel's necklace.]

Elena: Is that how you can walk in the day?
Isobel: Katherine helped me obtain it.
Elena: Who's my father?
Isobel: Not important. He was a teenage waste of space.
Elena: A name would be nice.
Isobel: It would, wouldn't it? You ask a lot of questions.
Elena: Why did you compel that man to kill himself? Right after he told me to stop looking for you.
Isobel: Dramatic impact. I wish it would have been more effective.
Elena: Human life means that little to you?
Isobel: Means nothing to me. It's just part of being what I am.
Elena: No it's not. I know other vampires, that's not true.
Isobel: Your new boyfriend over there by the pool table? Stefan Salvatore. Why Stefan? Why didn't you go for Damon? Or are you enjoying them both like Katherine did?
[Elena is shocked by the question. Stefan looks uncomfortable.]

[Damon and Alaric are waiting outside across the street.]

Damon: We should be in there.
Alaric: No, Isobel made it clear we're not to step a foot inside.
Damon: I'm not going to kill her in a crowded restaurant.
Alaric: You're not going to kill her period!
Damon: She ruined your life and you still want to protect her?
Alaric: She's my wife. [Damon looks at him] Was my wife. I looked for the woman I married but she wasn't there. Whoever that is, she's cold and detached.
Damon: Yeah, she's given up her humanity.
Alaric: Yeah, see, I don't get that. Stefan has his humanity, he's a good guy. And you're a dick and you kill people but I still see something human in you. But with her there was...nothing.
Damon: You can turn it off, like a button you can press. I mean, Stefan's different. He wants the whole human experience. He wants to feel every episode of How I Met Your Mother, so he shuts his feelings out. The problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel. Isobel chose the easier road - no guilt, no shame, no regret. I mean, come on, if you could turn it off, wouldn't you?
Alaric: You haven't.
Damon: Of course I have, Rick. It's why I'm so fun to be around.
[Inside, Elena and Isobel continue talking.]

Elena: Why did you want to meet me? Can't be to just catch up.
Isobel: Because I'm curious about you. But the real reason is: I want what your uncle wants. Johnathan Gilbert's invention.
Elena: How do you know my uncle?
Isobel: I used to spend a lot of time here when I was younger. John had a crush on me for years. He was the first one that told me about vampires.
Elena: So what made you want to be one?
Isobel: It's a very long list of reasons, Elena. All of which I'm sure you've thought about.
Elena: No.
Isobel: That was your first lie. It's inevitable, you're going to get old, Stefan won't. [Elena looks at Stefan. He seems sad]. Forever doesn't last very long when you're human.
Elena: I'm sorry but I don't have what you're looking for.
[She gets up but Isobel catches her arm and forces her to sit down.]

Isobel: Sit down [Stefan is going towards them] and tell your boyfriend to walk away. I want the invention.
Elena: I don't have it.
Isobel: I know that but Damon does and you're going get it for me.
Elena: He's not going to give it to me.
Isobel: Then the blood will be on your hands.
[She gets up and leaves.]

Isobel: It was nice meeting you Elena.
[Elena cries. Stefan is going toward her. Bonnie arrives; Elena gets up and looks at her. Stefan arrives behind Elena. Elena looks at him and then looks at Bonnie. Bonnie looks at Stefan and leaves.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is on the phone leaving a voicemail for Anna.]

Jeremy: Hey Anna. Where are you? What's up? Uh...Give me a call when you get this.
[Jeremy hangs up the phone.]

Jenna: How is Anna? I like that girl, she has fire.
Jeremy: I don't know. She won't return my calls.
[John enters in the kitchen.]

John: Girl trouble?
Jeremy: No, no trouble. Anna just owes me a call, that's it.
John: Is that the girl that I show you with at the Founders' pageant? You two are getting hot and heavy. When was the last time you saw her?
Jeremy: Why?
John: I was just making conversation. No one else in this house likes me. At least I can talk to you especially if you need someone to talk to about girls.
Jenna: Oh please! I'm eating.
[Jenna leaves the kitchen.]

John: So seriously, how well do you know Anna?
Jeremy: I know Anna extremely well.
John: I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything. I'm here to answer any questions that you have, to help you in any way I can.
Jeremy: Why?
John: Because your dad would want me to.
Jeremy: I'm ah...I'm good.
[Jeremy leaves the kitchen.]

Isobel's Residence
[Damon is shirtless. He's playing strip poker with Cherie.]

Damon: Oh Oh Cherie, you won again. I hope I'm wearing my good underwear.
[Damon gets up and begins to remove his belt. Isobel arrives.]

Isobel: And it's just one blast from the past after another. No, no, no.
[Damon closes his fly.]

Isobel: Degage, Cherie.
[Cherie gets up and leaves the room.]

Damon: It's good to see you, Isobel. I was just having fun with your naughty little minion.
Isobel: How did you find me?
[Damon comes vamp-speed towards Isobel.]

Damon: Searched all the neighborhood bank-owned foreclosures and found the most expensive one.
Isobel: Oh I should have known. You're the one who taught me that. What are you really doing here?
Damon: Well you caused quite a stir, you blew into town. Saw everyone except for the man who made you. I'm a little hurt. [leans in towards her.]
Isobel: I'm so sorry. [She twists Damon's head around at vamp-speed] Did you bring the device? [He disengages at vamp-speed.]
Damon: Heh. Ow. What are you doing with John Gilbert?
Isobel: We dated a few times when we were young. He was a little bit in love with me.
Damon: I'm sure. One of the many. Now, this little invention what do you want with it?
Isobel: Oh, me personally? I don't want anything with it. I'm just doing what I'm told. You know Damon we're on the same side.
[Isobel take's Damon's face in her hands.]

Damon: Oh yeah? What side is that?
Isobel: Katherine's. She wants John Gilbert to have the device and I think that you know that she's not happy when she doesn't get what she wants.
[Damon throws her off.]

Damon: Why are you doing her dirty work?
Isobel: Don't kill the messenger. We both know that you can't control Katherine. She does what she wants.
Damon: So do I.
Isobel: Oh really Damon? You do? [comes in close to him] What should we do now? [they laugh.]
[They begin to kiss each other. They fall vamp-speed on the sofa. Damon slams her on the floor at vamp-speed and holds her throat down to the floor.]

Damon: Now that I have your attention, listen up. You do not come into my town; threaten the people I care about. Going after Elena? Bad move. You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits because I do believe in killing the messenger. You know why? Because it sends a message. [He slams her head against the floor.] Katherine wants something from me? You tell that little bitch to come get it herself.
Gilbert Residence
[Elena is going down the stairs. Someone is knocking on the door. She opens the door. It's Bonnie.]

Elena: Hi.
Bonnie: Hey. I couldn't sleep last night. You were obviously upset about something and I just walked away. It's not me. That can't be us. You're my friend, Elena. If you need me I'm here for you and I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
Elena: I met my birth mother.
Bonnie: Oh. Was it...Are you okay?
[Elena cries and shakes her head. Bonnie embraces her.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Matt is building the float. Tyler arrives.]

Tyler: Hey man. So Caroline tells me you've been on your own for the past two weeks. Is everything okay?
Matt: You're asking me about my mom. Seriously? Look, man, why don't I just give tell her to give you a call when she comes back to town?
Tyler: Dude, that's not what I meant okay? I'm just trying to...I don't know what to say.
Matt: Good men, don't say anything. You're a dick, end of the story.
Tyler: I know. [Matt leaves.] Yeah, whatever.
[In a classroom, Bonnie is leafing through Emily's spell book. Elena enters the room.]

Bonnie: Hey! Thanks for meeting me. I wanted you to see this.
Elena: Is that Emily's spell book?
Bonnie: I've been going through it since Grams died. Check this out.
[Bonnie shows her the book.]

Elena: That's the vampire compass.
Bonnie: Yeah, according to Emily, Johnathan Gilbert never actually succeeded in inventing anything. Emily secretly spelled them all with magic. Compass, rings and the mystery device you told me about.
[She shows her a page from the book. The device is designed.]

Elena: Yeah that's it. Well, a part of it. Damon only has the one piece.
Bonnie: Emily pledged her loyalty to Katherine. But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed. This was the only way she could think of to help. To let Johnathan Gilbert believe that he'd actually invented these devices.
Elena: Does it say what it does?
[Bonnie reads the page.]

Bonnie: Are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
Elena: Yeah, I'm sure. Why?
Bonnie: This is a weapon. Against vampires.
[Elena is surprised.]

[Outside, Jeremy is walking and sees Elena.]

Jeremy: Elena!
Elena: Hey, have you seen Stefan? I need to find him.
Jeremy: No, not lately. Listen, do you have a second?
Elena: Yeah. What's up? What's going on?
Jeremy: Well, it's Anna. I've left her all this messages and she hasn't gotten back to me, not even a text.
Elena: Anna? I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
Jeremy: We're more than friends. Look, something could be seriously wrong and if you know anything you've got to tell me.
Elena: I haven't talked to her, Jer.
Jeremy: Are you lying to me right now?
Elena: Why do you say that?
Jeremy: Cause that's what you do. Lying. You lie about everything. I know what Anna is and I know that you know. So tell me, do you have any idea where she is?
Elena: No, but Jer...Jeremy wait! Jeremy!
[She turns around and Isobel is standing right behind her.]

Elena: Isobel. What are you doing here?
Isobel: I'm your mother, Elena. I want to be more involved in your life.
Elena: I don't want you in my life.
Isobel: I understand that. You already have a lot of people that you care about but I've been studying. Let's see if I got this right.
[She looks at Bonnie.]

Isobel: There is the witchy best friend, Bonnie. Gonna stay away from that one.
[She looks at Jeremy.]

Isobel: Oh...sad little brother Jeremy.
[She watches Caroline.]

Isobel: And there's Caroline...obnoxious Caroline. I got all of my info from her by the way. She had no idea who I was and she wouldn't stop yapping. Oh...
[She looks at Matt.]

Isobel: And there's Matt, friend, ex, yappy's future ex. Lots of connections there.
Elena: Matt is not involved in this.
Isobel: He's involved with you, isn't he?
Elena: Look, you shouldn't be here. You need to leave.
Isobel: No, I have some friends here too. Look, you see that man over here, standing next to Matt by the Float? His name is Frank, he's very handsome and he's also quite handy and he'd noticed that the axles are a little rusty which is very dangerous. So, all you have to do is apply a little bit of pressure and...
Elena: No!
[Frank jumps on the trailer above Matt. Matt's arm gets crushed. Elena tries to run for him, Isobel grabs her.]

Matt: Get this trailer! Come on guys help me!
[Tyler rushes to help him with some friends. They try to remove the trailer. Stefan arrives to help lift. They remove the trailer. Matt gets free. Caroline rushes to see Matt.]

Stefan: Caroline, call an ambulance.
Elena: Why are you doing this?
Isobel: I'm showing you how easy it is to hurt the people that you care about.
Elena: And you're doing this just because of Johnathan Gilbert's invention?
Isobel: Hand it over and all will be stop.
Elena: I told you, Damon is not going to give it to me.
Isobel: I think that you underestimate how much Damon cares about you.
Elena: He'll kill you before he gives it up.
Isobel: Is that before or after I kill your brother Jeremy?
[Elena turns to see Jeremy. He has disappeared.]

Elena: Jeremy?
[Stefan looks at her.]

Elena: Jeremy?!
[Elena looks everywhere. Isobel is gone too.]

Caroline: The ambulance is saying in 15-20 minutes.
Tyler: I have my car. I can take him to the hospital.
Matt: Caroline can take me.
Caroline: I didn't drive.
Matt: I'll wait. Its fine.
Caroline: You will not wait okay?! You need to see a doctor, Tyler is driving. End of story.
Matt: Fine!
Caroline: Go!
Tyler: I'll bring my car around.
[Matt looks at Caroline.]

Isobel's Residence
[John arrives. He enters in the house. There's a lot of suitcase in the entry.]

John: I see you're packing. That's a good sign.
Isobel: It won't be long now.
John: Did you get the missing piece? Where is it?
Isobel: I don't have it yet.
John: Then, why did you call me here?
[Isobel is going in another room. John follows her.]

Isobel: Because I have the next best thing.
[Isobel enters the room. Jeremy is in the room. Cherie and Frank are around him.]

John: What the hell are you doing?
Isobel: Getting what I want.
John: Yeah but he is my nephew and you're going let him go right this second!
Isobel: That gaudy ring on your finger comes off.
John: Come on Isobel, I know you okay? It's me John. You can't hurt a kid.
Isobel: I'll kill him to prove you wrong.
John: Really? Are you that far gone? Look, I know you've changed but the old Isobel is somewhere in there, isn't she? Come on let him go.
Isobel [to her minions]: Faites le souffrir.
[Cherie and Frank beat him and throw him on the floor. Isobel catches his hand and removes his ring.]

Isobel: Nice try. We'll see how you do without this.
[Isobel leaves the room. Jeremy looks at John, he's on the floor, bleeding.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Back in Alaric's classroom.]

Bonnie: Where is the device?
Stefan: Damon has it. He's going to be difficult to reason with.
Elena: We'll go to him, I'll talk to him.
Stefan: He's not just gonna hand it over, especially if it's harmful to vampires.
Elena: What if it's not?
[Elena, Bonnie and Stefan look at each other.]

Salvatore Boarding House
Damon: Absolutely not!
Elena: Just hear me out.
Damon: I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she could give it to John who is going to turn it to kill me. I like being a living dead person.
Elena: But it'll be useless, Bonnie can take its power away.
Damon: I don't trust her.
Bonnie: I can remove the original spell.
Elena: John and Isobel will never know.
Damon: No, I'll get Jeremy in my own way.
Stefan: Really? How are you going to do that? Because Isobel is a vampire and Jeremy could be dead the second you walk in the door.
Damon [to Bonnie]: Are you even up for this? I mean no offense, you're no Emily Bennett. Emily knew what she was doing.
Bonnie: I've been practicing.
Damon: It's not piano lessons, honey.
Bonnie: What's your favorite book?
Damon: What?
Bonnie: Name a book, any book.
Damon: Name a book...How about Call of the wild, Jack London?
[Bonnie turns and looks at the library. A book flies and lands in Damon's hands. Damon looks at the book.]

Damon: Jack London. Great parlor trick.
Elena: We're doing this, Damon. And we're doing it my way. Now give me the device. We're wasting time!
Damon [To Bonnie]: I don't trust you, I tried to kill you.
Bonnie: You're right, you can't trust me.
Elena: But you can trust me.
[Damon looks at her. Stefan looks at them. Damon gives her the device. Stefan looks at him.]

Elena: Thank you.
Isobel's Residence
[John is lying on the ground. Jeremy comes towards him with a towel.]

Jeremy: Here you go .[He gives him the towel.]
John: Thank you.
Jeremy: What is she after?
John: Your ancestor invented a weapon, a device that's extremely harmful to vampires and we've been trying to get it.
Jeremy: Why?
John: Because there's a group of vampires from a long time ago that wants revenge on this town.
Jeremy: But why would a vampire help you kill other vampires?
John: She has her own reasons for wanting them dead. Look Jeremy, no one ever thought vampires would return to this town. Not in modern times, but they have and we have to destroy them.
Jeremy: All of them? No, there are some good ones out there.
John: There's no such things.
Jeremy: I don't believe that.
John: Well, your dad did. And has his son that should mean something to you.
Jeremy: How did my father know about all this?
John: Who do you think told me about the family history?
Salvatore Boarding House
[Emily spell book is open. The device is next to it. Bonnie begins the spell. Damon, Elena and Stefan look at her.]

Bonnie: Done.
[Bonnie gives the device to Elena.]

Damon: Great, now what?
Elena: Now we give it to Isobel.
Mystic Falls
[In the town square, Elena is waiting for Isobel. She arrives behind her.]

Isobel: Where is the device?
Elena: Where is my brother?
Isobel: This isn't a negotiation. Where is the invention?
Elena: Where is my brother?
Isobel: Do you really think that I came alone?
[Frank and Cherie arrives behind Elena.]

Elena: Did you really think that I came alone?
[Damon and Stefan arrive behind Isobel. She looks at them.]

Isobel: For god sakes, call home.
Elena: What?
Isobel: Call home and ask to speak to your brother Jeremy.
[Elena takes her phone and calls home.]

Jeremy: Hello?
Elena: Jeremy, are you okay?
Jeremy: Yeah yeah I'm fine, Uncle John hit his head. It was an accident.
Jenna: We're all laughing.
Jeremy: But yeah I'm okay.
Elena: I'll be home soon, alright?
Jeremy: Yeah.
[He hangs up the phone and looks at his uncle.]

Elena: You were never gonna hurt him.
Isobel: No, I was going to kill him. Don't look for any redeeming qualities in me. I don't have any.
Elena: But you took a risk with Damon. How did you know that he was gonna give it to me?
Isobel: Because he's in love with you.
[Damon looks at Stefan, he looks uncomfortable. Stefan seems upset. Elena gives the device to Isobel.]

Elena [long pause]: Thank you.
Isobel: For what?
Elena: For being such a monumental disappointment. It keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact.
Isobel: Goodbye, Elena. As long as you have a Salvatore on each arm, you're doomed. Katherine was smart. She got out. But we all know that you're not Katherine.
[Isobel looks at her and leaves. Stefan embraces her. She looks at Damon. Then, Stefan looks at Damon. He looks down and leaves. Stefan looks after him.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy left a vocal message to Anna. Elena enters in Jeremy's room.]

Elena: Jeremy we have to talk about all this.
Jeremy: No, we really don't.
Elena: I don't know what Anna told you but there are things that you need to know.
Jeremy: Yeah? Because I'm pretty sure that your journal covered it.
Elena: You read my journal?
Jeremy: And save me the speech about invasion of privacy because I read a section about Damon erasing my memory, about what happened to Vicki.
Elena: Jeremy, please, you don't understand. The night that Vicki died, it was like mom and dad died all over again. It was all over your face and it hurt so much to see you like that. I just wanted to take away your pain. I'm so sorry.
Jeremy: Get out!
Elena: No, Jeremy!
Jeremy: Elena! Just get out. Please.
[She leaves and then she turns.]

Elena: Jer, I....
[He closes the door in her face.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Alaric is in an empty school hallway. Isobel is waiting for him.]

Alaric: What do you want?
Isobel: I totally get it, you, here as a history teacher. It's good.
Alaric: What the hell are you doing? You act like you don't care and yet here you are hunting me down.
Isobel: I'm leaving. I just thought I said goodbye.
Alaric: You couldn't be bothered the first time so why now?
Isobel: You hate me. Good.
Alaric: Does that make it easier for you? I mean what is the whole point of this exercise?
Isobel: What did you expect? You spent all this time trying to track me down. What did you think you would find?
Alaric: The woman who gave me this [He shows her the ring]. I mean you act like you don't care but you care enough to protect me after you left.
Isobel: I was a different person back then.
Alaric: Right! And that person is gone. The woman that I married, the woman I loved, she's just...she's gone.
[He removes his ring and throws it to her.]

Alaric: You expect me to believe that?
[He throws the vervain on the floor.]

Isobel: What are you doing?
Alaric: Well, I'm ring free, I'm vervain free. So, either kill me or compel me because I don't believe it. Not for a second.
[Isobel pushes him against the wall.]

Isobel: I wanted this-I needed this-and I'm going to regret it forever. This was my mistake, not yours.
[She compels him.]

Isobel: You're not going to remember this. I loved you, I did and when I think about what I gave up it hurts. But now your heart is free of me, it's easier this way. Goodbye Ric.
[She puts the ring on his finger. She touches his face and leaves. A moment later Alric seems to come out of a trance.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is going to bed. Anna appears.]

Jeremy: Anna? What are you doing here?
Anna [crying]: My mother. She's dead.
Jeremy: What?
Anna: She was killed.
Jeremy: Oh, my god, Anna. Hey, I'm so sorry.
Anna: I know I'm not supposed to be here but I don't have anywhere else to go.
[He embraces her.]

Jeremy: It's okay.
Salvatore Boarding House
[Damon is pouring himself a glass of scotch. Stefan arrives.]

Damon: Would you like one? Say it, whatever it is, purge, get it out.
Stefan: It's about what Isobel said.
Damon: What about?
Stefan: Well, I know that you and Elena have bounded and I know that she cares about you and...I know you care about her.
Damon: Well, this is going in an interesting direction.
Stefan: I'm just concerned about Elena being hurt. She considers you a friend.
Damon: Same here, Elena is a very good friend. Actually, she might qualify as my only...friend. Is that a problem?
Stefan: So, at the risk of sounding like uh...like a jealous boyfriend.
Damon: Oh, there's no risk, you do.
Stefan: History will not be repeating itself where Elena is concerned. Do you understand what I'm saying?
Damon: Sure. Sure.
[Stefan runs toward him at vamp-speed.]

Stefan: Do you understand?
Damon: Whatever you say man, I mean honestly we're just friends and as a friend I wasn't looking forward to telling her the truth anyway so, I'll let you do it.
Stefan: What truth?
Damon: About John. Because I know you guys don't like to keep secrets from each other.
Stefan: What are you talking about?
Damon: Am I the only one around here who has the ability to put two and two together? Isobel! Hello? She dated John when she was 15; she gets pregnant and ends up at the doctor's office of John's brother. Now, what do you think John's role is in all this? I mean, go ahead, and think about it, I'll wait. Did you get it? You there yet?
Stefan: So you think that John is Elena's father?
Damon: Ding, ding, ding, ding!
Stefan: What proof do you have?
Damon: I don't need any proof, that's a DNA test for John, Elena and Maury Povich to deal with but I know how well you deal with these bombs so...Sleep tight.
[He leaves the room.]

Damon: Oh and when you do tell Elena and she needs a friend to talk to about anything, I'm here for her.
[He leaves, Stefan looks at him.]

Gilbert Residence
[John is on the couch, his phone rings. It's Isobel.]

John: Hello?
Isobel: On your doorstep you'll find what you've been looking for.
John: And my ring?
Isobel: Don't screw this up. You know what you have to do, John.
[He opens the door and pick up the envelope.]

John: I got it. I won't fail.
[He opens the envelope.]

Isobel: You better not. Katherine wants all of those tomb vampires dead, and I want to add two more to that list.
[He retrieves his ring and puts it on his finger.]

John: Let me guess.
Isobel: Stefan and Damon. I don't want this life for her.
John: That was always part of the plan. Consider them gone.
Isobel: She's our daughter, John. We owe that to her.
John: I know.
[He hangs up the phone.]

Mystic Grill
Caroline: So you're not going to tell me what happened?
Bonnie: I did something bad, Caroline, and I lied about it.
Caroline: To who?
Bonnie: To Elena. I pretended to do something I didn't really do.
Caroline: What are you talking about?
Bonnie: I couldn't do what she wanted me to do. It wasn't right. Grams would have never done it, so I couldn't either. But when Elena finds out, she's never gonna forgive me.

Gilbert Residence and Salvatore Boarding House
[Elena and Stefan are getting dressed the for Founders' Day Parade. She puts her necklace on as Jenna helps Elena get into her dress.]

Elena: Ouch, this dress hurts.
Jenna: Suck it in, baby.

Mystic Falls High School
[Everybody is preparing for Founders' Day. Carol Lockwood is supervising.]

Mrs Lockwood: No, no, no, no, no! It's all wrong! The marching band should be in front of the Historic Society. Matt, get up on the float. Boys, I asked you to put chairs on the Founders' Float. Ladies! Time to get on the float.
[Stefan is standing alone, waiting. Damon arrives.]

Damon: Look at you, all retro.
Stefan: What are you doing here?
Damon: Why wouldn't I be here? Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention, Isobel is gone and it's Founders' Day! I'm here to eat cotton candy and steal your girl.
Stefan: Don't start with me, Damon.
Damon: Oh, you started this Stefan with that whole I'm insecure, leave Elena alone speech. I'm enjoying that.
Stefan: As long as you heard it.
Damon: What? You have no sense of humor, Stefan.
Stefan: Actually I've no sense of 'Damon humor'.
Damon: 'Damon humor'...Hey look, I get it, I get it. I'm the better, hotter, superior choice and you're scared, now that Katherine is out of the picture, that I'm gonna turn all my attention to Elena. But don't worry, Elena is not Katherine.
Stefan: You're right, she's not.
[Damon and Stefan see Elena approaching. In her period dress she looks strikingly like Katherine. She smiles at them and curtsies.]

Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is in his bedroom, putting his clothes on for Founders' Day. Anna arrives.]

Jeremy: Anna.
Anna: Look at you!
Jeremy: I know, it's stupid, huh? I'm part of the parade; but how are you? I've been so worried and I feel awful.
Anna: Why? You didn't kill my mother, your uncle did.
Jeremy: Are you sure it was him?
Anna: Who else would have done it?
John: He doesn't understand, Anna, it's who he is. He hates all vampires. He's just doing what he thinks is right.
Anna: Are you defending him?
Jeremy: No, no way. It's just...I do understand where he's coming from. He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just...he's trying to protect it.
Anna: They do want revenge, or at least they did, but that's why we separated from them. My mom wasn't after revenge; she just wanted her life back. I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.
Jeremy: You're leaving?
Anna: I've been thinking...you could come with me. I could turn you. I mean...you said you wanted me to. Here.
[She gives him a flask with her blood.]

Anna: It's my blood. If you die with it in your system, you'll come back.
Jeremy: Anna...
Anna: I know you, what it's like for you...being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand. But when you're a vampire, you don't have to feel that way. You can shut it off. I can show you how.
Jeremy: I wanted to, I did.
[He turns away from Anna. She looks sad.]

Jeremy: But I don't think I can. Sorry.
[He looks at the flask. When he looks up again, Anna is gone.]

Mystic Falls High School
[Elena and Stefan are talking about John being her father.]

Elena: John?! Is that even possible?
Stefan: There is no proof, but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager and he was the one who brought her to your dad's office for the delivery.
Elena: My whole life I've never liked this man. I...
Stefan: Sorry, I'm sorry. I just...I wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it on you on some typically inappropriate way.
Elena: No, I'm happy that you told me, I just...I really hope that it's not true. What I am supposed to do? Do I just...confront him and say are you my biological father?
Stefan: I guess, when you're ready.
Elena: I'm never gonna be ready. Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about. Jeremy hates me, and why wouldn't he? My journal gave him every single reason to.
Stefan: He's just hurt, he's confused.
Elena: He's never going to forgive me for Vicki, for taking away his memories, for lying to him.
Stefan: He's your brother, he'll forgive you. Just give him some time.
[Caroline is taking pictures with Matt before the Founders' Day Parade, in their Civil War costumes.]

Bonnie: Say cheese!
Caroline [to Matt]: Oh wait! Hide your cast, it's not era-appropriate!
Matt: Seriously?
Caroline: Yes!
Matt: Okay, fine.
[Bonnie takes the picture, Tyler arrives.]

Caroline: I want one with Bonnie now.
Tyler: Here, I can take it.
[Matt looks at him.]

Matt: I'll be on the float.
[Tyler looks at Caroline.]

Tyler: I said I was sorry!
Caroline: You made out with his mother and then you beat him to a pulp. You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry.
[She looks at him and leaves.]

[Elena is running after Jeremy.]

Elena: Jeremy! I was wondering where you were. You look great, and you guys did a really great job on the float.
Jeremy: Go away, Elena.
Elena: Jeremy, come on! Please! I don't want it to be like this between us.
Jeremy: Why don't you have Damon erase my memory again? Then I could go back to being your in-the-dark little brother.
Elena: Jer, please.
Jeremy: Just don't! You can't fix this that easily; something like this doesn't just get fixed.
[He looks at her and leaves.]

[The floats are parading. Carol Lockwood commentates.]

Mrs Lockwood: Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Fall's high school Marching Band!
[The marching band and the cheerleaders parade, everyone applauds and scream.]

Mrs Lockwood: And for a little local history, Mr. Saltzman's students have recreated Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek.
[The float arrives in the street. Jeremy and Tyler are in it, they wave to the crowd and pretend to shoot at each other.]

Mrs Lockwood: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our stunning Miss Mystic Falls Court and their handsome escorts.
[Elena, Stefan, Caroline and Matt, and the rest of the Mystic Falls Court and their escorts are on the float; they laugh and wave to the crowd.]

Mrs Lockwood: This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls. Aren't they beautiful?
[Bonnie is in the crowd. She smiles and waves at Elena. Elena smiles and waves back to Bonnie. Damon walks in front of Bonnie and stops, smiles and waves to Elena. She rolls her eyes and looks away. She looks at Stefan waves to the rest of the crowd. Damon turns around and sees Bonnie.]

Bonnie: What do you want?
Damon: Just watching the parade.
[She begins to leave.]

Damon: Where are you going?
Bonnie: Away from you.
Damon: I wanna say something to you.
Bonnie: Just leave me alone!
Damon: Thank you. The device that Emily spelled could have killed me. I don't take what you did lightly so...thank you.
Bonnie: I did it for Elena.
Damon: I know that, but I'm still very grateful. And...I owe you.
[They look at each other for a moment.]

Damon: Enjoy the parade.
[He leaves.]

Mrs Lockwood: Let's cheer for the Mystic Fall's high school football team. Alright! Let's show them our support, everybody!
[The float and the cheerleaders arrives.]

Grayson Gilbert's Office
[John is with Mayor Lockwood, he's preparing the device.]

John: This is the key. Once inserted, the device will be activated. It will work only once, for an estimated time of 5 minutes.
Mayor Lockwood: Yes, how does it work?
John: It's a high-pitched frequency that humans can't hear. Any vampires within a five-block radius will be incapacitated, exposing them. At that time, the sheriff's deputies will inject them with vervain and bring them here, when we will finish them off.
Mayor Lockwood: And you're certain they're attacking tonight?
John: I have a source. One of the vampires from the tomb confirmed the attack.
Building
[The vampires from the tomb are having a meeting. The leader is speaking and pointing at a map of the Town Square.]

Vampire leader: Everybody listen up! The plan stays the same. We wait until the firework start; until then, we blend in. Stay a part of the celebration; they'll never see us coming.
Grayson Gilbert's Office
John: They want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864. It makes us their target.
Building
[The leader is showing the other vampires a plan of the Mystic Fall's Town Square.]

Vampire leader: This area here is the stage. This is where the Founding Families are gonna be. Any questions?
Grayson Gilbert's Office
Mayor Lockwood: We're taking an enormous risk. We're talking about our families, John!
Building
[Anna arrives.]

Vampire leader: Anna? What are you doing here?
Grayson Gilbert's Office
John: This is the only way to draw them out and kill them...all of them.
Mystic Grill
[Damon is standing alone. Elena arrives, and he looks at her. Elena has changed back into her modern clothes.]

Damon: I like you better like this. The period look, it...didn't suit you.
Elena: Is that an insult?
Damon: Actually Elena, it is a compliment of the highest order.
Elena: Look, I know Stefan is worried about our...friendship.
Damon: Did he mention something to you too?
Elena: No, did he mention something to you?
Damon: No, nothing worth repeating.
Elena: So, I think you should stop with the flirty little comments and that eye-thing that you do.
Damon [smiling and doing the eye-thing]: What eye thing?
Elena: Don't make me regret being your friend okay?
[He seems hurt. Elena looks at Jeremy who's sitting alone. She goes towards Jeremy. Damon looks at them.]

Elena: I don't believe that we can't fix this. I lied, I was wrong. But you're my brother, Jer, and I love you, and I have to fix it. So just tell me, what can I do?
Jeremy: You go to hell, Elena.
[He gets up and leaves. Damon looks at him.]

Town Square
[Jeremy is walking, and Damon appears walking behind him.]

Damon [mocking Jeremy]: I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them. Being a teenager is so hard!
Jeremy: You're a dick!
Damon: You do not talk to me like that! I'm not your sister. And for now on, [Damon grabs Jeremy's arm] don't talk to your sister that way either.
Jeremy: So, you're going to kill me just cause I hurt Elena's feelings?
Damon: Cut her some slack.
Jeremy: She erased my memories.
Damon: No, I did! She was protecting you.
Jeremy: It wasn't her call to make.
[He tries to leave but Damon grabs his arm and pulls him back roughly.]

Jeremy: Let go of me before I cause a scene.
Damon: You'll be unconscious before you even got a word out.
[Stefan arrives.]

Stefan: Let him go.
[Damon releases him. Stefan puts himself between them and looks at Jeremy.]

Stefan: Are you alright?
Jeremy: Yeah.
Stefan [looking at Damon]: What my brother is trying to say is, don't blame Elena for this. Damon turned Vicki, I killed her. She was a threat to you, and she was a threat to your sister. I'm sorry that it happened, I wish that it hadn't.
[Damon looks at Stefan.]

Jeremy: You shouldn't have made me forget...
[Jeremy leaves.]

Damon: Good cop, bad cop. I like it.
Stefan: What are you doing?
Damon: He's being a punk.
Stefan: Elena's relationship with her brother is none of your business. So stay out of it!
Damon: Oh, there's only one do-gooder role available. My bad. I'm sorry.
[He laughs.]

Stefan: Get over yourself. We both know you're not doing this for the right reasons.
Damon: You see, there you go with that little jealousy act again. What are the right reasons, Stefan? Enlighten me, please!
Stefan: Well, see Damon, it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing for nothing in return, and I know that it is an entirely foreign concept to you. I completely understand that you wouldn't get it.
[He looks at him and leaves.]

Sheriff's Office
[Sheriff Forbes is talking with John and Mayor Lockwood.]

Sheriff Forbes: You want to use our town as bait? It's too dangerous, it's insane!
[She closes the door.]

Mayor Lockwood: We've gone over the plans with all your deputies, they're all on board.
Sheriff Forbes: You've gone behind my back?
Mayor Lockwood: Yeah, because we knew this is exactly how you'd react.
Sheriff Forbes: Our children are here.
John: Liz, we need to do this. We have no choice; this is the reason for the Secret Council. Our founding fathers created the Secret Council for just this purpose!
[Long pause. They look at each other.]

Sheriff Forbes: I'm the Sheriff, it's my call and I say no.
John: Richard, let me speak to the Sheriff alone.
[He looks at them and leaves.]

Sheriff Forbes: John, you're not thinking clearly, I'm not gonna change my mind about this.
[She turns her back and goes toward her desk. John hits her behind the head. She's unconscious. He removes her gun belt and handcuffs her to the radiator. He looks at her and leaves.]

Mystic Falls
[It's night, Damon is looking and walking around in the town square, when he runs into Anna.]

Damon: You're still around?
Anna: There's something you need to know. The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight.
Damon: How do you know this?
Anna: I went to them. They think I'm with them but I'm not. They want the Founding Families dead.
Damon: When is this supposed to happen?
Anna: When the firework start.
[Long pause.]

Damon: John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them.
Anna: Then we can't be here!
Damon: It doesn't work, it's been deactivated.
Anna: Well, then a lot of people are gonna die.
Damon: Where are they right now?
Anna: They're already here, Damon.
[The tomb vampires are meeting in front of a building.]

Vampire leader: Remember, we don't know which of them ingests vervain. It's not about the feed, it's about the kill. You know what to do.
[They walk into the crowd and disperse.]

[Damon is walking toward Alaric.]

Damon: Ric!
Alaric: Yeah?
Damon: You keep those nifty little vampire darts in the car?
Alaric: Yeah, why do you ask?
Damon: Because this square is crawling with tomb vampires. I think we might need a stake or two.
Alaric: Yeah, got it.
[Alaric leaves, Damon sees Stefan and Elena. He goes toward them and takes Elena's hand.]

Elena: What are you doing?
Damon: Saving your life. Fifteen words or less...Tomb vamps are here. Founding families are their target. [To Stefan] Get her out of here, now!
[Damon starts to leave.]

Stefan: Wait, where are you going?
Damon: That's more than fifteen words, Stefan.
[He leaves.]

Elena: Wait, Jeremy is out here somewhere.
Stefan: Let's go find him, come on!
Mystic Grill
[Tyler is at the pool table. Matt and Caroline are sitting at a table, they look at him.]

Caroline: There was this time, freshman year, when Bonnie and I were in a fight and we swore that we would never talk again.
Matt: Caroline, give it a rest.
[Mayor Lockwood arrives at the Mystic Grill. He goes toward Tyler.]

Mayor Lockwood: What are you doing here? I told you to go home.
Tyler: I decided not to.
Mayor Lockwood: If I tell you to do something, you do it!
[He grabs Tyler's arm and begins to shout.]

Tyler: Let go of me!
[Caroline arrives.]

Caroline: Mayor, is everything okay?
[Matt arrives too; the Mayor looks at them.]

Mayor Lockwood: Please Tyler; I need you to go home, now. Take your friends with you.
Matt: Why? What's going on?
Mayor Lockwood: I can't explain. All of you need to get home, now. Please.
Tyler: Yeah, okay.
[The Mayor gives him his car's keys.]

Mayor Lockwood: Here, take my car, it's out back. Caroline, Matt go with him.
[They look at him and leave.]

[Jeremy is in front of the restrooms. Anna goes toward him.]

Jeremy: Anna what are you doing here? My uncle could see you.
Anna: I don't care about that. I needed to find you. Come here.
[They go in the restroom.]

Town Square
[Mayor Lockwood is giving his speech.]

Mayor Lockwood: For one hundred and fifty years, Mystic Falls has been the kind of town that everybody wants to call home: safe, prosperous, welcoming. And we have the Founders to thank for that. That's why I'd like to dedicate this evening's firework display to their legacy.
[Everyone applause, the tomb vampires on in the crowd, looking at the Mayor. He looks at one of the deputies.]

Grayson Gilbert's Office
[John is waiting for the signal. One of the deputies is with him.]

John: Get in position.
[The deputy goes out. John goes toward the device and looks at it.]

Town Square
Mayor Lockwood: Enjoy the show!
[The firework starts. Mayor Lockwood and his wife start to leave.]

Mayor Lockwood [to his wife]: Stay close.
[Tomb vampires are following them. Bonnie runs into one of them.]

Vampire leader: Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Bonnie: I'm sorry.
[He leaves. She looks at him. She gets a vision of what he is and follows him.]

Grayson Gilbert's Office
[John is preparing the device, Damon arrives.]

Damon: Do you have any idea what you've done?
John: Yeah, as a matter of fact I do.
[Damon goes toward him, John activates the device. Damon falls, he grabs the sides of his head and screams.]

Elena: What?
Stefan: My head!!

Mystic Grill
[Anna and Jeremy are in the restrooms. Anna grabs her head and begins to scream.]

Jeremy: Anna what's wrong? Anna!
Anna: Please, make it stop!
[We see a succession of images: Stefan is holding his head in the Town Square, Damon is holding his head at Grayson Gilbert's office, Anna is in Jeremy's arms screaming in the restroom of the Grill. The tomb vampires' leader falls, and one of the deputies injects him vervain. John injects vervain to Damon.]

Mystic Falls
[Tyler is driving his father's car when he suddenly hears the device.]

Tyler: What the hell is that?
Caroline: What's the matter?
Tyler: That noise!
Matt: Wait, what noise?
[Tyler lets go of the wheel, grabs his head and begins to scream.]

Caroline: Tyler! Tyler!
[He loses control of the car.]

Matt: Dude, hey! Caroline, the wheel!
[She tries to grab the wheel, Tyler screams. The car crashes into a wall.]

Town Square
[Stefan is on the floor, holding his head. Elena's with him. A deputy runs toward him but Alaric runs interference and hurriedly talks to him.]

Alaric: Hey, I got this one. There's one over there. Take this, go! Go! Go!
[The deputy leaves. Alaric goes toward them and helps Stefan to get up. They go toward the stairs.]

Elena: I don't know what happened, he just dropped.
Alaric: Yeah, he's not the only one. The cops have gotten everyone who's gone down, injecting them with vervain.
Elena: What?
[Long pause, they look at Stefan.]

Elena: They're rounding up the vampires.
[Carol Lockwood is with her husband. He's on the floor.]

Mrs Lockwood: Please help him, he just went down.
[The deputies inject him with vervain. Mayor Lockwood is unconscious and there is blood leaking out his ears.]

Mystic Grill
[Anna and Jeremy are still in the restrooms.]

Anna: Ahhhhhhhh my head!
[She screams. One of the deputy enters.]

Deputy [into the radio]: I got one.
[They inject her with vervain, the other holds Jeremy.]

Jeremy: Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, leave her alone!
[The deputy takes her, the other stays with Jeremy.]

Jeremy: Leave her alone! Anna!!!
Grayson Gilbert's Office
[The device is stopped. John takes everything back and goes in the basement. Damon is on the floor, unconscious. Deputies are bringing more vampires.]

John: The device is done; the only thing keeping them down is vervain. We don't have much time, let's finish this.
[Damon begins to wake up; one of the Deputies is pouring gasoline everywhere. John begins to leave but Anna catches his leg. She's on the floor. He looks at her.]

John: Anna.
[Damon turns his head and looks at them.]

John [to the Deputy]: You can head up; I'll take it from here.
[The Deputy leaves, Anna tries to get up, Damon is still looking at them. John takes a stake from his back.]

Anna: Please...no!
[He stakes her, Damon looks at him. John pours more gasoline. He goes up the stairs and pours a trail of gasoline up them. He goes out of the basement, lights a match and throws it on the gasoline. A fire starts. Some of the vampires begin to burn. Damon looks at them.]

Town Square
[Stefan is better, he's talking with Elena.]

Elena: Are you okay?
Stefan: It was like needles were piercing my skull and it just stopped.
[Alaric arrives.]

Alaric: I saw at least five vampires go down. They're taking them to your family's old building.
Stefan: It's the Gilbert's device. It has to be.
Elena: But how did he get it to work? Bonnie unspelled it.
Alaric: Maybe she didn't.
Elena: She did, we saw her do it!
Stefan: No, no, no, he's right. Think about it. We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires.
Elena: So we could protect you.
Stefan: And Damon. Vampires. Where is Damon?
Alaric: I don't know. I haven't seen him since this started.
Elena: Can you get my brother, take him home?
Alaric: Of course.
Elena: Let's go.
Sheriff's Office
[Sheriff Forbes is still handcuffed to the radiator. Carol Lockwood arrives.]

Mrs Lockwood: Liz, are you okay?
Sheriff Forbes: There's a key in my belt...
Mrs Lockwood: What's going on?!
Sheriff Forbes: There's a key in my belt, I need you to get it.
[She takes the key.]

Mrs Lockwood: I've been looking everywhere for you, something happened to Richard. They took him.
Sheriff Forbes: Who took him?
Mrs Lockwood: Your deputies. I don't understand, he's not a vampire!
[Sheriff Forbes opens her handcuffs and gets up.]

Sheriff Forbes: Let's go!
Grayson Gilbert's Office
[The basement is on fire. Damon looks around him and sees the mayor.]

Damon: Mayor. Is that you?
Mayor Lockwood: What are you doing here?
Damon: I'm a vampire. What's your excuse?  No, really. The vervain didn't affect you, you're not a vampire, what the hell are you?
[The mayor scoots backwards to get away from Damon. He bumps into the tomb vampires' leader, who is waking.]

Vampire leader: Mayor Lockwood!
[The vampire leader reaches an arm around Mayor Lockwood from behind and grabs his chin, pulls violently and snaps his neck. Damon seeing this slowly smiles.]

Town Square
[Matt and Caroline are out of the car; an ambulance arrived, Tyler is on the ground, unconscious.]

Matt: Hey, are you okay?
Caroline: I'm fine, I'm fine.
Matt: No, they need to check you out.
Caroline: No, I'm fine, I'm fine. They're helping Tyler.
[The paramedics are examining Tyler. One of them opens one of Tyler's eyes, it flashes amber-gold before going back to brown.]

Paramedic: What the hell?!
Matt: What's wrong?
Paramedic: His eyes!
[They look at him when suddenly, Tyler wakes up.]

Tyler: What happened?
Matt: Dude, don't scare me like that!
[Matt turns his head, Caroline is on the ground, unconscious.]

Matt: Caroline! Guys, over here! Caroline, wake up!
[Elena and Stefan are walking when suddenly Stefan hears the fire.]

Stefan: Wait, wait, wait, I can hear them. The building is on fire.
Elena: What?
Stefan: The building's on fire!
Grayson Gilbert's Office
[The building is still on fire. Damon tries to gets up, but a beam falls down in front of him.]

Town Square
[Elena and Stefan go toward John, talking to him.]

Elena: Where is Damon?
John: With the rest of them, where he should be. It's over for Damon.
Elena: You're crazy!
John: Why? Because I'm doing what should have been done a hundred and forty five years ago? This is the right thing, Elena.
[Stefan is looking at the building. John looks at him.]

John: Go ahead, you won't make it out. It'll save me the trouble of killing you myself.
[Stefan looks at Elena.]

Stefan: You know the building well, is there another way in?
Elena: Utility door, there's one around the side.
[He goes toward the building, Elena follows him but John catches her arm.]

John: You take one more step and I'll alert those deputies that they missed a vampire.
Elena: I'm asking you not to.
John: That doesn't mean anything to me.
Elena: As my father, it should.
[Long pause, they look at each other.]

John: You know.
Elena: I wasn't sure, now I am.
[She looks at him and goes toward the building.]

Grayson Gilbert's Office
[Stefan runs towards the emergency door but Bonnie arrives.]

Bonnie: Hey, you can't go in there!
[Stefan opens the door.]

Bonnie: The fire will take you out.
Stefan: He's my brother, Bonnie!
[He goes into the building, he tries to open the basement's door but the doorknob is too hot. Bonnie is looking at the building when Elena arrives.]

Elena: Stefan!
Bonnie: Elena, you can't go in there!
Elena: Bonnie, what are you doing?
Bonnie: I'm sorry I lied to you.
[She catches Elena's arm, closes her eyes and begins to recite a spell.]

Bonnie: Ex spiritum intacullum, in terrum incendium, fes matos salvis adisdum!
Elena: Bonnie, I've got to get in there!
[Bonnie is still reciting the spell. In the building, Stefan can finally open the door but the fire is too large. Suddenly, the flames diminish, thanks to Bonnie's spell. Stefan goes into the basement and finds Damon.]

Stefan: Damon! Come on, hurry!
[Stefan picks Damon up and vamp-runs out of the basement. Outside, Bonnie finishes her spell and looks at Elena.]

Elena: Bonnie...Bonnie, what is it? Are they gonna be okay?
[Stefan and Damon come out of the building, Elena runs toward them.]

Elena: Oh my god!
Mystic Grill
[Elena is standing alone, Stefan rejoins her.]

Elena: The fire is out. The story is the building's old wiring is what caused it.
Stefan: Did you see where Damon went?
Elena: No, he just kind of disappeared.
Stefan: Figures.
[She embraces him.]

Elena: I'm so glad you're okay.
Stefan: I try so hard...to hate him. I guess it's just pointless.
Elena: You care about him, so do I. But I love you Stefan, and I know that you are worried about that.
Stefan: I just...you know, I know my brother.
Elena: But I love you, Stefan.
Stefan: I know the trouble he can cause.
[She takes his face in her hands.]

Elena: I love you Stefan, you!
[They look at each other and she kisses him.]

Elena: You have nothing to worry about, okay?
[She kisses him again.]

Elena: Jenna called, Jeremy's home, I'm just gonna run over to the school to pick up my dress, my clothes and the rest of my stuff and then I'll check on him.
Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is on his bed; he looks at the flask, gets up and puts it in his drawer. He turns his head: Damon is here.]

Jeremy: What are you doing here?
Damon: Anna's dead.
Jeremy: I figured that once they took her away.
Damon: I know you cared about her.
Jeremy: Yeah, I did.
Damon: I saw her killed. I was watching and all I could think about was...I wanted to help her, but I couldn't.
Jeremy: Why are you telling me all this?
Damon: I took away your suffering once before. I can do it again, but it's your choice.
Jeremy: Look, I know you think you took it away, but it's still there. Even if I can't remember why. I still feel empty, and alone, and making me forget won't fix it. It won't fix what's really wrong.
Damon: What I did to Vicki was wrong. I'm sorry for my part.
Jeremy: Anna said that vampires don't have to feel pain; that they could turn it off, if they shut out their humanity.
Damon: It's very true.
Jeremy: Is it easier that way?
Damon: Is what easier?
Jeremy: Life.
Damon: Life sucks either way, Jeremy. But, at least if you're a vampire, you don't have to feel bad about it if you don't want to.
Jeremy: Is that what you did?
Damon: I did it for a...I did it for a very long time and life was a lot easier.
[He looks at Jeremy and leaves.]

Mystic Falls Hospital
[Matt is sitting alone in the hallway, Tyler joins him.]

Tyler: Hey man. I'm so sorry. Look, I don't even know what happened.
Matt: It's okay man. She'll be alright.
[Tyler sits down with him, Sheriff Forbes arrives. Matt gets up.]

Matt: What's happening? Is she alright?
Sheriff Forbes: There was some internal bleeding; they're taking her into surgery.
Matt: What else did they say? Is she gonna be okay?
Sheriff Forbes: They're gonna do everything they can.
[He looks at her and sits down.]

Sheriff Forbes: Tyler, have you talked to your mom?
Tyler: I left her a message telling her I was here.
Sheriff Forbes: You need to call her.
Tyler: What is it?
Sheriff Forbes: ...It's your dad.
Gilbert Residence
[Jeremy is in the bathroom, looking in the mirror. He has the flask of Anna's blood in his hand. He opens it and drinks the blood. He finds Elena's pain pills from her car accident and pours them on the counter. He picks one up, preparing to take it.]

Mystic Grill
[Stefan goes out, Bonnie arrives.]

Stefan: Oh, hey.
Bonnie: Hey.
Stefan: You...you just missed Elena.
Bonnie: I was looking for you actually.
Stefan: Oh.
Bonnie: Elena is my best friend, and because she loves you, I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.
Stefan: I'm very grateful Bonnie, I hope you know that.
Bonnie: I do...but I hope you know that things have to change. Damon has to change.
Stefan: We both want the same thing.
Bonnie: We both want to protect the people we care about. The difference is, for you, Damon is one of them. You saw what I was able to do tonight. I know who I am now, and if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood, I'll take him down. Even if I have to take you with him.
Stefan: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Bonnie: Let's hope it doesn't.
Gilbert Residence
[Damon goes out of the house. Elena arrives, she's holding her dress.]

Elena: What are you doing here?
Damon: Failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing.
Elena: Which was...?
Damon: It's not important. Let me take this for you.
[He takes the dress and her bag, and sets it down.]

Elena: Thank you.
Damon: You know, I came to this town wanting to destroy it. Tonight, I found myself wanting to protect it. How does that happen? I'm not a hero, Elena. I don't do good. It's not in me.
Elena: Maybe it is.
Damon: Nah, it's reserved for my brother, and you...and Bonnie...who, even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.
Elena: Why do you sound so surprised?
Damon: Because she did it for you. Which means that somewhere along the way, you decided that I was worth saving. And I wanted to thank you for that.
Elena: You're welcome.
[He kisses her on the cheek; they look at each other. He hesitates and then he kisses her she pulls away slightly and then Damon grabs Elena and they kiss passionately for a few seconds until Jenna opens the door and interrupts them. They stop and Damon tries to hide himself.]

Elena: Hi...
Jenna: It's late, you should probably come inside.
[She looks at Damon, grabs her dress and goes into the house. Jenna closes the door.]

Jenna: What are you doing?
Elena: I don't want to talk about it.
[Outside, Damon looks at the house, touches his lips and leaves.]

[Jeremy is in the bathroom, he's taken all the pills. He goes into his bedroom, lays on the bed and passes out.]

[John is in the kitchen, he opens the fridge and when he closes it, Elena is there.]

John: You scared me.
Elena: Sorry.
John: You know...I first met Isobel when I was a teenager. I fell in love with her instantly, although I'm pretty sure she never loved me. She was special. A part of why I hate the vampires so much is because of what she became, how it ruined her. And I never would have sent her to Damon had I known she wanted to turn.
[She looks at him while she puts away dishes.]

John: It's my fault. I'm telling you this because I hoped maybe you'd understand.
Elena: Thank you.
John: Can I help?
[She looks at his ring.]

Elena: Sure.
[She cuts his fingers off of the hand with the Gilbert ring with the knife she was putting away, and pushes him against the sink. John screams in pain.]

John: Katherine?!
[Her eyes change and become vampiric.]

Katherine: Hello, John. Goodbye, John.
[She stabs him.]

[Outside, Elena is walking towards the front door. She's on the phone with Stefan.]

Elena: I looked everywhere. Yeah, someone definitely took my stuff. I'm just gonna check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital. Can you meet me there? Okay. I love you Stefan.
[She enters the house and goes to the bottom of the staircase.]

Elena: [Shouting up the stairs.] Jeremy?! Are you up?
[She hears a noise coming from the kitchen and starts walking towards it.]
